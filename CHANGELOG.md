# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add support for Plex Other Video libraries
  - These libraries will now appear as ETV Other Video libraries
  - Items in these libraries will have tag metadata added from folders just like local Other Video libraries
  - Thanks @raknam for adding this feature!
- Add *experimental* support for `On Demand` channel progress
  - With `On Demand` channel progress, the playout will only advance when the channel is being streamed
  - When the channel is idle, the playout is unmodified and will be shifted forward as needed so no content is missed
  - Setting a channel to `On Demand` progress will disable alternate schedules
  - The `On Demand` setting will only be used for `Flood` playouts (NOT `Block` or `External JSON`)
  - It is NOT recommended to use fixed start times with `On Demand` progress
    - This will probably be disabled with a future update
- Add `Default Filler` to `Deco` system
  - After all blocks are scheduled/added to the playout, a second pass will be made to insert filler
  - Default filler will be shuffled and inserted in all unscheduled time between blocks
  - Default filler will stop scheduling when the next item would extend into primary content
  - Alternatively, default filler can be configured to `Trim To Fit`
    - In this case, the last item that would extend into primary content is trimmed to end exactly when the primary content starts
- Add **experimental** playout type `YAML`
  - This playout type uses a YAML file to declare content and describe how the playout should be built
  - Content currently supports search queries
  - Playout instructions currently include `count`, `pad to next`, and `repeat`
    - `count`: add the specified number of items (from the referenced content) to the playout
    - `duration`: play the referenced content for the specified duration
    - `pad to next`: add items from the referenced content until the wall clock is a multiple of the specified minutes value
    - `repeat`: continue building the playout from the first instruction in the YAML file
- Add channel logo generation by @raknam
  - Channels without custom uploaded logos will automatically generate a logo that includes the channel name
- Add two new API endpoints
  - Reset playout for channel
    - POST `/api/channels/{channelNumber}/playout/reset`
  - Scan library
    - POST `/api/libraries/{libraryId}/scan`
- Add Deco setting to `Use Watermark During Filler`
  - This setting is turned OFF by default, meaning filler will NOT use the configured watermark unless this is manually turned on

### Fixed
- Add basic cache busting to XMLTV image URLs
  - This should help with clients not showing correct channel logos or posters
- Fix artwork in other video libraries by @raknam
- Fix adding items to empty playlists
- Fix filler preset editor and deco dead air fallback editor to only show supported collection types
- Fix infinite loop caused by impossible schedule (all collection items longer than schedule item duration)
- Fix selecting audio and subtitle streams with two-letter language codes
- Fix adding pad filler to content that is less than one minute in duration
- Generate unique identifier for virtual HDHomeRun tuner by @raknam
  - This allows a single Plex server to connect to multiple ETV instances
- Include *all* language codes from media library in preferred audio and subtitle language options
  - Language codes where an English name cannot be found will be at the bottom of the list
- Fix local libraries to detect external subtitle files with unrecognized language codes
- Fix playback selection of subtitles with unrecognized language codes
- Fix incorrectly removing block items that are hidden from EPG when deco filler is applied
- Fix deco selection when deco is scheduled until midnight
  - Previously, this deco item would be ignored so watermark and filler would be missing
- Fix movies with missing medata by generating fallback metadata
  - This allows these movies to appear in the Trash where they can be deleted
- Fix synchronizing trakt lists from users with special characters in their username
  - Note that these lists MUST be added as URLs; the short-form `user/list` will NOT work with special characters
- Fix local subtitle scanner to detect non-lowercase extensions (e.g. `Movie (2000).EN.SRT`)

### Changed
- Remove some unnecessary API calls related to media server scanning and paging
- Improve trakt list URL validation; non-trakt URLs will no longer be requested

## [0.8.7-beta] - 2024-06-26
### Added
- Add `Active Date Range` to block playout template editor to allow limiting templates to a specific date range
  - This is year-agnostic, meaning the Month/Day range will apply to every year
  - This also supports wrapping the end of the year (e.g., start 12/1 and end 1/15)
- Add new `Deco` system for "decorating" channels with non-primary content
  - Decos currently contain
    - Watermarks
    - Dead Air Fallback (i.e. fallback filler)
  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco groups for organization
  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco templates for filling a "day" with decos
  - In the playout template editor, playout template items can have *both* a block template and a deco template
    - This allows watermarks and dead air fallback to change at different times than primary content
  - Block playouts can also have a default deco
    - This will apply whenever a deco template is missing, or when a deco template item cannot be found for the current time
    - Effectively, this sets a default watermark and dead air fallback for the entire playout
- Add `XMLTV Days To Build` setting, which is distinct from the existing `Playout Days To Build` setting
  - The value for `XMLTV Days To Build` cannot be larger than `Playout Days To Build`
  - This allows, for example, a week of playout data while optimizing XMLTV data to only a day or two
- Add health check to detect config folder issue on MacOS
  - ETV versions through v0.8.4-beta (using dotnet 7) stored config data in `$HOME/.local/share/ersatztv`
  - ETV versions starting with v0.8.5-beta (using dotnet 8) store config data in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ersatztv`
  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV has NOT been launched on MacOS, it will automatically migrate the config folder on startup
  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV *has* been launched on MacOS, a failing health check will display with instructions on how to resolve the config issue to restore data
- Add `Video Profile` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor when `h264` format is selected
- Add `Video Preset` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor for some combinations of acceleration and video format:
  - `Nvenc` / `h264`
  - `Nvenc` / `hevc`
  - `Qsv` / `h264`
  - `Qsv` / `hevc`
  - `None` / `h264`
  - `None` / `hevc`
- Add *experimental* list type `Playlist`
  - Playlists contain an ordered list of:
    - Collections
    - Multi-Collections
    - Smart Collections
    - TV Shows
    - TV Seasons
    - Artists
    - Movies
    - Episodes
    - Music Videos
    - Other Videos
    - Songs
    - Images
  - Playlists can be added to schedules as a schedule item
  - Each time through the playlist, one item will be scheduled from each playlist item (if `Play All` is unchecked)
    - NB: This does not mean every collection will always schedule one item; the normal flood playout restrictions like duration and fixed start times still apply here
  - If `Play All` is checked, that playlist item will play all of its items each time through the playlist
    - This can be helpful if you want to play entire collections in a specific order, e.g.
      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 2
      - Every episode from Show 2 Season 3
      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 3
  - Playlist items with fewer media items will be re-shuffled (if applicable) before those with more media items
- Add two new environment variables to customize config and transcode folder locations
  - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER`
  - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER`
- Add checkbox to allow use of B-frames in FFmpeg Profile (disabled by default)

### Fixed
- Fix some cases of 404s from Plex when files were replaced and scanning the library from ETV didn't help
- Fix more wildcard search phrase queries (when wildcards are used in quotes, like `title:"law & order*"`)
- Fix non-wildcard simple queries when asterisks are used in quotes, like `title:"m*a*s*h"`
- Fix bug where channels would unnecessarily wait on each other
  - e.g. in-progress streams would delay responding with a playlist when new streams were starting
- Update Plex show title in ETV when changed in Plex
- Reindex seasons and episodes when show is updated from media server
  - This is needed to keep `show_*` tags accurate in the search index (e.g., `show_title`, `show_studio`)
- Fix external subtitle detection to support forced/sdh subtitles with language tag before and after forced/sdh tag:
  - `Something.forced.en.srt`
  - `Something.sdh.en.srt`
  - `Something.en.forced.srt`
  - `Something.en.sdh.srt`
- Fix playback from Jellyfin 10.9 by allowing playlist HTTP HEAD requests
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` segment duration (previously 10s, now 4s)
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` error video generation
- Fix MySql database migrations
- Fix Plex library scans with MySql/MariaDB
- Fix block playout playback when no deco is configured
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` to delete old segments (use less disk space while channel is active)
- Fix template and deco template editors to prevent items that go beyond midnight
- Fix block playout random seeds
  - Different blocks within a single playout will now correctly use different random seeds (shuffles)
  - Erasing block playout history will also generate new random seeds for the playout
- Fix building playouts that use mid-roll filler and have content without chapter markers
  - When this happens, mid-roll will be treated as post-roll
- Fix VAAPI decoder capability check
  - This caused some streams to incorrectly use software decoding
- Fix scheduling loop/failure caused by some duration schedule items
- Fix `video_bit_depth` search field for Plex media
- Fix template and deco template editors with MariaDB/MySql backend
- Fix transcoding 10-bit source content using QSV acceleration on Windows

### Changed
- Show health checks at top of home page; scroll release notes if needed
- Improve `HLS Segmenter V2` compliance by:
  - Serving fmp4 segments when `hevc` video format is selected
    - > 1.5. The container format for HEVC video MUST be fMP4.
  - Using accurate BANDWIDTH value in multi-variant playlist
  - Using proper MIME types for statically-served `.m3u8` and `.ts` files
  - Serving playlists with gzip compression
- Use `HLS Segmenter V2` for channel preview when channel is configured for `HLS Segmenter V2`
- Detect and use `/dev/dri/card*` devices in addition to `/dev/dri/render*` devices
- Change default folder locations in docker using new environment variables
    - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/config`
    - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/transcode`
    - If the old locations are still present in docker, these variables will be ignored, so you can migrate at your own pace
      - Old config location: `/root/.local/share/ersatztv`
      - Old transcode location: `/root/.local/share/etv-transcode`

## [0.8.6-beta] - 2024-04-03
### Added
- Add `show_studio` and `show_content_rating` to search index for seasons and episodes
- Add two new global subtitle settings:
  - `Use embedded subtitles`
    - Default value: `true`
    - When disabled, embedded subtitles will not be considered for extraction (text subtitles), or playback (all embedded subtitles)
  - `Extract and use embedded (text) subtitles`
    - Default value: `false`
    - When enabled, embedded text subtitles will be periodically extracted, and considered for playback
- Add `sub_language` and `sub_language_tag` fields to search index
- Add `/iptv` request logging in its own log category at debug level
- Add channel guide (XMLTV) template system
  - Templates should be copied from `_channel.sbntxt`, `_movie.sbntxt`, `_episode.sbntxt`, `_musicVideo.sbntxt`, `_song.sbntxt`, or `_otherVideo.sbntxt` which are located in the config subfolder `templates/channel-guide`
    - Copy the file, remove the leading underscore from the name, and only make edits to the copied file
  - The default templates will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started
  - The templates use [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax
  - The templates contain comments describing which fields are available for use in the templates
- Add *experimental* and *incomplete* `Images` library kind
  - Image libraries have fallback metadata added like Other Video libraries (every folder is a tag)
  - Image library items currently default to a duration of 15 seconds
    - The `Media` > `Images` page can be used to configure image durations at a folder level
    - Child folders with unset durations will inherit the closest ancestor's duration
- Add *experimental* new streaming mode `HLS Segmenter V2`
  - In my initial testing, this streaming mode produces significantly fewer playback warnings/errors
  - If it tests well for others, it *may* replace the current `HLS Segmenter` in a future release
- Add setting to change XMLTV data from `Local` time zone to `UTC`
  - This is needed because some clients (incorrectly) ignore time zone specifier and require UTC times
- Support `.ogv` video files in local libraries

### Fixed
- Fix antiforgery error caused by reusing existing browser tabs across docker container restarts
  - Data protection keys will now be persisted under ErsatzTV's config folder instead of being recreated at startup
- Fix bug updating/replacing Jellyfin movies
  - A deep scan can be used to fix all movies, otherwise any future updates made to JF movies will correctly sync to ETV
- Automatically generate JWT tokens to allow channel previews of protected streams
- Fix bug applying music video fallback metadata
- Fix playback of media items with no audio streams
- Fix timestamp continuity in `HLS Segmenter` sessions
  - This should make *some* clients happier
- Fix `Other Video`, `Song` and `Image` fallback metadata tags to always include parent folder (folder added to library)
- Allow playback of items with any positive duration, including less than one second
- Fix VAAPI transcoding of OTA content containing A53 CC data
- Fix AV1 software decoder priority (`libdav1d`, `libaom-av1`, `av1`)
- Fix some stream failures caused by loudnorm filter
- Fix multi-collection editor improperly disabling collections/smart collections that haven't already been added to the multi-collection
- Fix path replacement logic when media server paths use inconsistent casing (e.g. `\\SERVERNAME` AND `\\ServerName`)
- Fix *many* search queries, including actors with the name `Will`
- Fix sqlite `database is locked` error that would crash ETV on startup after search index corruption
- Fix bug where replacing files in Plex would be missed by subsequent ETV library scans
  - This fix will require a one-time re-scan of each Plex library in full
  - After the initial full scan, incremental scans will behave as normal
- Fix edge case where some local episodes, music videos, other videos, songs, images would not automatically be restored from trash
- Fix `MPEG-TS` playback when JWT tokens are enabled for streaming endpoints

### Changed
- Log search index updates under scanner category at debug level, to indicate a potential cause for the UI being out of date
- Batch search index updates to keep pace with library scans
  - Previously, search index updates would slowly process over minutes/hours after library scans completed
  - Search index updates should now complete at the same time as library scans
- Do not unnecessarily update the search index during media server library scans
- Use different library for reading song metadata that supports multiple tag entries
- Update `/iptv` routing to make UI completely inaccessible from that path prefix
- Use CUDA 11 instead of CUDA 12 in NVIDIA docker image to significantly lower required driver version
- Allow block durations with 5-minute increments (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc.)

## [0.8.5-beta] - 2024-01-30
### Added
- Respect browser's `Accept-Language` header for date time display
- Add new schedule item setting `Fill With Group Mode`
  - This setting is only available when a `Collection`, `Multi-Collection` or `Smart Collection` is scheduled with `Duration` or `Multiple` playout modes
  - Use this setting when you want to schedule a collection containing groups (show or artists), with only videos from a single group (show or artist) being used in each rotation
  - The options are `None`, `Ordered Groups` and `Shuffled Groups`:
    - `None`: no change to scheduling behavior - all groups (shows and artists) will be shuffled/ordered together
    - `Ordered Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a fixed order
    - `Shuffled Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a shuffled order
- Add new playout type `External Json`
  - Use this playout type when you want to manage the channel schedule using DizqueTV
  - You must point ErsatzTV to the channel number json file from DizqueTV, e.g. `channels/1.json`
  - For playback, ErsatzTV will first check for the appropriate media file file locally
    - If found, ErsatzTV will run ffprobe to get statistics immediately before streaming from disk
  - When local files are unavailable, ErsatzTV must be logged into the same Plex server as DizqueTV
    - ErsatzTV will ask Plex for statistics immediately before streaming from Plex
- Add new *experimental* playout type `Block`
  - **This playout type is under active development and updates may reset or delete related playout data**
  - Many planned features are missing, incomplete, or result in errors. This is expected.
  - Block playouts consist of:
    - `Blocks` - ordered list of items to play within the specified duration
    - `Templates` - a generic "day" that consists of blocks scheduled at specific times
    - `Playout Templates` - templates to schedule using the specified criteria. Only one template will be selected each day
  - Much more to come on this feature as development continues
- Show chapter markers in movie and episode media info
- Add two new API endpoints for interacting with transcoding sessions (MPEG-TS and HLS Segmenter):
  - GET `/api/sessions`
    - Show brief info about all active sessions
  - DELETE `/api/session/{channel-number}`
    - Stop the session for the given channel number
- Add channel preview (web-based video player)
  - Channels MUST use `H264` video format and `AAC` audio format
  - Channels MUST use `MPEG-TS` or `HLS Segmenter` streaming modes
    - Since `MPEG-TS` uses `HLS Segmenter` under the hood, the preview player will use `HLS Segmenter`, so it's not 100% equivalent, but it should be representative
- Add button to stop transcoding session for each channel that has an active session
- Add more log levels to `Settings` page, allowing more specific debug logging as needed
    - Default Minimum Log Level (applies when no other categories/level overrides match)
    - Scanning Minimum Log Level
    - Scheduling Minimum Log Level
    - Streaming Minimum Log Level

### Fixed
- Fix error loading path replacements when using MySql
- Fix tray icon shortcut to open logs folder on Windows
- Unlock playout when playout build fails
- Ignore errors deleting old HLS segments; this should improve stream reliability
- Update show year when changed within Plex
- Fix crop scale behavior with NVIDIA, QSV acceleration
- Fix bug that corrupted uploaded images (watermarks, channel logos)
  - Re-uploading images should fix them
- Recreate XMLTV channel list (including logos) when channels are edited in ErsatzTV
  - This bug caused the ErsatzTV logo to be used instead of channel logos in some cases
- Update drop down search results in main search bar when items are created/edited/removed
- Fix green line at bottom of video when NVIDIA accel is used with intermittent watermark
- Fix error starting streaming session when subtitles are still being extracted for the current item

### Changed
- Upgrade from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- In schedule items, disambiguate seasons from shows with the same title by including show year
  - Old format: `Show Title (Season Number)`
  - New format: `Show Title (Show Year) - Season Number`
- Remove FFmpeg Profile `Normalize Loudness` option `dynaudnorm` as it often caused streams to fail to start
- Disable loudness normalization by default in new FFmpeg Profiles
- Use AAC audio format by default in new FFmpeg Profiles

## [0.8.4-beta] - 2023-12-02
### Fixed
- Fix playout builder crash with improperly configured pad filler preset
- Properly validate filler preset mode pad to require `filler pad to nearest minute` value
- Fix bug where previously-synchronized collection tags would disappear
  - This bug affected Jellyfin, Emby and Plex collections
- Fix detection of AMF hardware acceleration on Windows

## [0.8.3-beta] - 2023-11-22
### Added
- Add `Scaling Behavior` option to FFmpeg Profile
  - `Scale and Pad`: the default behavior and will maintain aspect ratio of all content
  - `Stretch`: a new mode that will NOT maintain aspect ratio when normalizing source content to the desired resolution
  - `Crop`: a new mode that will scale beyond the desired resolution (maintaining aspect ratio), and crop to desired resolution
    - **This mode does NOT detect black and intelligently crop**
    - The goal is to fill the canvas by over-scaling and cropping, instead of minimally scaling and padding
- Include `inputstream.ffmpegdirect` properties in channels.m3u when requested by Kodi
- Log playout item title and path when starting a stream
  - This will help with media server libraries where the URL passed to ffmpeg doesn't indicate which file is streaming
- Add QSV Capabilities to Troubleshooting page
- Add `language_tag` and `seconds` fields to search index
- Allow synchronizing Plex `TV Show` libraries that use `Personal Media Shows` agent
- Include Noto CJK Fonts in docker images to support those characters in generated subtitles like songs and music video credits
- Support show fallback metadata with folder names like `Show.Name(1992)`

### Fixed
- Fix playout bug that caused some schedule items with fixed start times to be pushed to the next day
- Fix playout bug that prevented padded durations from fitting within a schedule item of the same duration
  - For example, filler that padded to 30 minutes would often not fit in a 30 minute duration schedule item
- Fix VAAPI transcoding 8-bit source content to 10-bit
- Fix NVIDIA subtitle scaling when `scale_npp` filter is unavailable
- Remove ffmpeg and ffprobe as required dependencies for scanning media server libraries
  - Note that ffmpeg is still *always* required for playback to work
- Fix PGS subtitle pixel format with Intel VAAPI
- Fix some cases where `Copy` button would fail to copy to clipboard
- Fix some cases where ffmpeg process would remain running after properly closing ErsatzTV
- Fix QSV HLS segment duration
  - This behavior caused extremely slow QSV stream starts
- Fix displaying multiple languages in UI for movies, artists, shows
- Fix MySQL queries that could fail during media server library scans
- Fix scanning Jellyfin libraries when library options and/or path infos are not returned from Jellyfin API
- Fix error indexing music videos in `File Not Found` state
- Fix bug scheduling duration filler when filler collection contains item with zero duration
- Fix bug displaying television seasons for shows that have no year metadata

### Changed
- Upgrade ffmpeg to 6.1, which is now *required* for all installs
- Use new ffmpeg throttling method to minimize cpu/gpu use without impacting audio normalization
- Change FFmpeg Profile `Normalize Loudness` setting from checkbox to dropdown
  - `Off`: do not normalize loudness
  - `loudnorm`: use `loudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally higher CPU use)
  - `dynaudnorm`: use `dynaudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally lower CPU use)
- Jellyfin collection scanning will no longer happen after every (automatic or forced) library scan
    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned
    - There is a new table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Jellyfin collections as needed
- In FFmpeg Profile editor, only display hardware acceleration kinds that are supported by the configured ffmpeg
- Test QSV acceleration if configured, and fallback to software mode if test fails
- Detect QSV capabilities on Linux (supported decoders, encoders)
- Use hardware acceleration for error messages/offline messages
- Try to parse season number from season folder when Jellyfin does not provide season number
  - This *may* fix issues where Jellyfin libraries show all season numbers as 0 (specials)
- Rework Plex collection scanning
    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned
    - There is a table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Plex collections as needed
    - Plex smart collections will now be synchronized as tags, similar to other Plex collections

## [0.8.2-beta] - 2023-09-14
### Added
- Automatically rebuild search index after improper shutdown
- Add *experimental* support for Elasticsearch as search index backend
  - No query changes should be needed since ES is backed by lucene and supports the same query syntax
  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `ELASTICSEARCH__URI` (e.g. `http://localhost:9200`)
    - `ELASTICSEARCH__INDEXNAME` (default is `ersatztv`)
- Add *experimental* support for MySQL/MariaDB database provider
  - ***There is no functionality to migrate data between providers***
  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `PROVIDER` - set to `MySql`
    - `MYSQL__CONNECTIONSTRING` - (e.g. `Server=localhost;Database=ErsatzTV;Uid=root;Pwd=ersatztv;`)
- Add option to use shared Plex servers, not just owned servers
  - This can be enabled by setting the env var `ETV_ALLOW_SHARED_PLEX_SERVERS` to any non-empty value
- Show Plex server names in Libraries page

### Fixed
- Fix subtitle scaling when using QSV hardware acceleration
- Fix log viewer crash when log file contains invalid data
- Clean channel guide cache on startup (delete channels that no longer exist)
- Fix Emby movie libraries so local file access is not required
- Fix adding alternate schedule
- Fix parsing show title from NFO file that also contains season information

### Changed
- Optimize transcoding session to only work ahead (at max speed) for 3 minutes before throttling to realtime
  - This should *greatly* reduce cpu/gpu use when joining a channel, particularly with long content
- Allow manually editing (typing) schedule item fixed start time
- Use different control for editing schedule item duration, and allow 24-hour duration
  - This is needed if you want a default/fallback alternate schedule to fill the entire day with one schedule item
  - The schedule item should have a fixed start time of midnight (00:00) and a duration of 24 hours
- Use Direct3D 11 for QSV acceleration on Windows

## [0.8.1-beta] - 2023-08-07
### Added
- Add custom resolution management to `Settings` page

### Fixed
- Only allow a single instance of ErsatzTV to run
  - This fixes some cases where the search index would become unusable
- Fix VAAPI rate control mode capability check

### Changed
- Rework startup process to show UI as early as possible
  - A minimal UI will indicate when the database and search index are initializing
  - The UI will automatically refresh when the initialization processes have completed
- Force ffmpeg to use one thread when hardware acceleration is used since hardware acceleration does not support multiple threads

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2023-06-23
### Added
- Disable playout buttons and show spinning indicator when a playout is being modified (built/extended, or subtitles are being extracted)
- Automatically reload playout details table when playout build is complete
- Add `Discard To Fill Attempts` setting to duration playout mode
  - This setting only has an effect when it's configured to be greater than zero and when using `Shuffle` or `Random` playback order
  - When the current item is longer than the remaining duration, it will be discarded and ETV will try to fit the next item in the collection, up to the configured number of times
  - When the remaining duration is shorter than all items in the collection, the normal filler logic will be used
- Add `Finish` column to playout detail table

### Fixed
- Skip checking for subtitles to extract when subtitles are not enabled on a channel/schedule item
- Properly scale subtitles when using hardware acceleration
- Fix color normalization of content with missing color metadata when using NVIDIA acceleration
- `VAAPI`: explicitly use `CQP` rate control mode when it's the only compatible mode
- Fix scaling anamorphic Emby content that Emby claims is not anamorphic

### Changed
- `HLS Direct` streaming mode
    - Use `MPEG-TS` container/output format by default to maintain v0.7.8 compatibility
      - `MP4` and `MKV` container/output format can still be configured in `Settings`
    - Improve `MP4` compatibility with certain content
- For `Pad` and `Duration` filler - prioritize filling the configured pad/duration
  - This will skip filler that is too long in an attempt to avoid unscheduled time
  - You may see the same filler more often, which means you may want to add more filler to your library so ETV has more options
- Update ffmpeg, libraries and drivers in all docker images

## [0.7.9-beta] - 2023-06-10
### Added
- Synchronize actor metadata from Jellyfin and Emby television libraries
  - New libraries and new episodes will get actor data automatically
  - Existing libraries can deep scan (one time) to retrieve actor data for existing episodes
- `HLS Direct` streaming mode
    - Use `MP4` container/output format by default, with new global option to use `MKV` container/output format
    - `MP4` output format: stream copy dvd subtitles
    - `MKV` output format: stream copy any embedded subtitles

### Fixed
- Fix extracting embedded text subtitles that had been incompletely extracted in the past
- Fix fallback filler looping by forcing software mode for this content
  - Other content will still use hardware acceleration as configured
  - Hardware-accelerated fallback filler may be re-enabled in the future
- Fix playout building when shuffle in order is used with a single media item
- Fix pgs subtitle burn in from media server libraries
- Fix subtitle and watermark overlays with RadeonSI VAAPI driver
- Fix NVIDIA pipeline to use hardware-accelerated decoder with 8-bit h264 content

### Changed
- Timeout playout builds after 2 minutes; this should prevent playout bugs from blocking other functionality

## [0.7.8-beta] - 2023-04-29
### Added
- Add `Season, Episode` playback order
  - This is currently *only* available when a show is added directly to a schedule
  - This will ignore release date and sort exclusively by season number and then by episode number

  - When configured, a JWT signed with the configured signing key is required to be passed in the query string as `access_token`, for example:
    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/channels.m3u?access_token=ABCDEF`
    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/xmltv.xml?access_token=ABCDEF`
  - When channels are retrieved this way, the access token will automatically be passed through to all necessary urls
  - Note that ONLY the `/iptv` endpoints will require auth when JWT is configured

### Fixed
- Fix scaling anamorphic content from non-local libraries
- Fix direct streaming content from Jellyfin that has external subtitles
  - Note that these subtitles are not currently supported in ETV, but they did cause a playback issue

- For performance reasons, limit console log output to errors on Windows
  - Other platforms are unchanged
  - Log file behavior is unchanged

## [0.7.5-beta] - 2023-03-05
### Added
- Use AV1 hardware-accelerated decoder with VAAPI, QSV, NVIDIA when available
- Use VP9 hardware-accelerated decoder with VAAPI when available

### Fixed

- Improve VAAPI encoder capability detection on newer hardware
- Fix trash page to properly display episodes with missing metadata or titles
- Fix playback of content with yuv444p10le pixel format
- Fix case where some multi-episode files from Plex would crash the scanner

### Changed
- Upgrade all docker images and windows builds to ffmpeg 6.0
- Plex, Jellyfin and Emby libraries now retrieve all metadata and statistics from the media server
  - File systems will no longer be periodically scanned for libraries using these media sources
- Plex, Jellyfin and Emby libraries now direct stream content when files are not found on ErsatzTV's file system
  - Content will still be normalized according to the Channel and FFmpeg Profile settings
  - Streaming from disk is preferred, so every playback attempt will first check the local file system
- Use libvpl instead of libmfx to provide intel acceleration in vaapi docker images
- Search queries no longer remove duplicate results as this was causing incorrect behavior
- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as "default" over number of audio channels
    - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a mono "default" track will now prefer the "default" track
- Support many more season folder names with local television libraries

## [0.7.4-beta] - 2023-02-12
### Added
- Add button to copy/clone schedule from schedules table
- Synchronize episode tags and genres from Jellyfin, Emby and Local show libraries
- Add `Deep Scan` button to Jellyfin and Emby libraries
  - This is now required to update some metadata for existing libraries, when targeted updates are not possible
  - For example, if you already have tags and genres on your episodes in Jellyfin or Emby, you will need to deep scan each library to update that metadata on existing items in ErsatzTV

### Fixed

### Changed
- Merge generated `Other Video` folder tags with tags from sidecar NFO
- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as "default" when multiple candidate streams are available
  - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a stereo "default" track will now prefer the "default" track

## [0.7.3-beta] - 2023-01-25
### Added
- Attempt to release memory periodically
- Add OpenID Connect (OIDC) support (e.g. Keycloak, Authelia, Auth0)
  - This only protects the management UI; all streaming endpoints will continue to allow anonymous access
  - This can be configured with the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `OIDC__AUTHORITY`
    - `OIDC__CLIENTID`
    - `OIDC__CLIENTSECRET`
    - `OIDC__LOGOUTURI` (optional, needed for Auth0, use `https://{auth0-domain}/v2/logout?client_id={auth0-client-id}` with proper values for domain and client-id)
- Add *experimental* alternate schedule system
  - This allows a single playout to dynamically select a schedule based on date criteria, for example:
    - Weekday vs weekend schedules
    - Summer vs fall schedules
    - Shark week schedules
  - Alternate schedules can be managed by clicking the calendar icon in the playout list
  - Playouts contain a prioritized (top to bottom) list of alternate schedules
  - Whenever a playout is built for a given day, ErsatzTV will check for a matching schedule from top to bottom
  - A given day must match all alternate schedule parameters; wildcards (`*any*`) will always match
    - Day of week
    - Day of month
    - Month
  - The lowest priority (bottom) item will always match all parameters, and can be considered a "default" or "fallback" schedule

### Fixed
- Fix schedule editor crashing due to bad music video artist data
- Fix bug where playouts would not maintain smart collection progress on schedules that use multiple smart collections
- Fix library scanning on osx-arm64
- Fix ability to remove some media server libraries from ErsatzTV

### Changed

  - This ensures errors will display even when hardware acceleration is misconfigured
- Call scanner process only when scanning is required based on library refresh interval
- Use lower process priority for scanner process with unforced (automatic) library scans
- Disable V2 UI and APIs by default
  - V2 UI can be re-enabled by setting the env var `ETV_UI_V2` to any value

- Fix saving some external subtitle records to database

### Changed
- Upgrade to dotnet 7
- Upgrade all docker images to ubuntu jammy and ffmpeg 5.1.2
- Limit library scan interval between 0 and 1,000,000
  - 0 means do not automatically scan libraries
  - 1 to 999,999 means scan if it has been that many hours since the last scan
- Use new `ErsatzTV.Scanner` process for scanning all libraries
  - This should reduce the ongoing memory footprint

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2022-12-11
### Fixed
- Fix removing Jellyfin and Emby libraries that have been deleted from the source media server
- Fix `Work-Ahead HLS Segmenter Limit` setting to properly limit number of channels that can work-ahead at once

- Extract font attachments after extracting text subtitles
  - This should improve SubStation Alpha subtitle rendering
- Detect VAAPI capabilities and fallback to software decoding/encoding as needed
- Add audio stream selector scripts for episodes and movies
  - This will let you customize which audio stream is selected for playback
  - Episodes are passed the following data:
    - `channelNumber`

      - `index`: the stream's index number, this is what the function needs to return
      - `channels`: the number of audio channels
      - `codec`: the audio codec
      - `isDefault`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as default
      - `isForced`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as forced
      - `language`: the stream's language
      - `title`: the stream's title
  - Movies are passed the following data:
      - `channelNumber`
      - `channelName`
      - `title`
      - `guids`: array of string ids like `imdb_1234` or `tvdb_1234`
    - `preferredLanguageCodes`: array of string preferred language codes configured for the channel
    - `audioStreams`: array of audio stream data, each containing
        - `index`: the stream's index number, this is what the function needs to return
        - `channels`: the number of audio channels
        - `codec`: the audio codec
        - `isDefault`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as default
        - `isForced`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as forced
        - `language`: the stream's language
        - `title`: the stream's title
- Add new fields to search index
  - `video_codec`: the video codec
  - `video_bit_depth`: the number of bits in the video stream's pixel format, e.g. 8 or 10
  - `video_dynamic_range`: the video's dynamic range, either `sdr` or `hdr`

### Changed
- Change `Multi-Episode Shuffle` scripting system to use Javascript instead of Lua

## [0.6.9-beta] - 2022-10-21
### Fixed

  - This only happened with fixed start schedule items following a schedule item with tail or fallback filler
- Fix NFO reader bug that caused inaccurate warning messages about invalid XML and incomplete metadata
- Fix reverse proxy SSL termination support by supporting `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
- Fix automatic playout reset scheduling
  - Playouts would reset every 30 minutes between midnight and the configured time, instead of only at the configured time
- XMLTV: properly group schedule items with `Custom Title` followed by item(s) with `Guide Mode` set to `Filler`

### Added
- Add music video credits template system
  - Templates are selected in each channel's settings
  - Templates should be copied from `_default.ass.sbntxt` which is located in the config subfolder `templates/music-video-credits`
    - Copy the file, give it any name ending with `.ass.sbntext`, and only make edits to the copied file
  - The default template will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started
  - The template is an [Advanced SubStation Alpha](http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm) file using [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax
  - The following fields are available for use in the template:
    - `resolution`: the ffmpeg profile's resolution, which is used for margin calculations
    - `title`: the title of the music video

    - `duration`: the timespan duration of the music video, which can be used to calculate timing of additional subtitles
    - `stream_seek`: the timespan that ffmpeg will seek into the media item before beginning playback
- Add `Multi-Episode Shuffle` playout order for `Television Show` schedule items
  - The purpose of this playout order is to improve randomization for shows that normally have intro, multiple episodes, and outro
  - This playout order requires splitting the parts into individual files (e.g. splitting `s01e01-03.mkv` into `s01e01.mkv`, `s01e02.mkv` and `s01e03.mkv`)
  - This playout order requires a lua script in the config subfolder `scripts/multi-episode-shuffle`
  - The lua script should be named for the television show's guid, e.g. `tvdb_12345.lua` or `imdb_tt123456789.lua`
  - The script defines the number of parts that each un-split file typically contains
  - The script also defines a function to map each episode to a part number (or no part number i.e. `nil` if an episode has not been split)
  - All groups of part numbers (i.e. all part 1s, all part 2s) will be shuffled
  - The playout order will then schedule a random part 1 followed by a random part 2, etc
    - Un-split (`nil`) episodes will be randomly placed between re-combined parts (e.g. part1, part2, part3, un-split, part1, part2, part3)
- Add `ETV_BASE_URL` environment variable to support reverse proxies that use paths (e.g. `/ersatztv`)

### Changed
- No longer place watermarks within content by default (e.g. within 4:3 content padded to a 16:9 resolution)
  - This can be re-enabled if desired using the `Place Within Source Content` checkbox in watermark settings

### Added
- Add `QSV Device` option to ffmpeg profile on linux
- Add guids to search index (e.g. `imdb:tt000000`, `tvdb:12345`)

## [0.6.7-beta] - 2022-09-05
### Fixed
- When all audio streams are selected with `HLS Direct`, explicitly copy them without transcoding
  - This only happens when the channel does not have a `Preferred Audio Language`
- Fix scanner crash caused by invalid mtime
- `VAAPI`: Downgrade libva from 2.15 to 2.14
- Fix bug with XMLTV that caused some filler to display with primary content details
- Multiple fixes for content scaling with `Nvidia`, `Qsv` and `Vaapi` accelerations
- Properly scale image-based subtitles

  - Logic was also added to detect infinite playout build loops in the future and stop them
- Fix bug where `Other Videos` wouldn't be included in scheduling mode `Shuffle In Order`

### Added
- Add `Preferred Audio Title` feature
    - Preference can be configured in channel settings and overridden on schedule items
    - When a title is specified, audio streams that contain that title (case-insensitive search) will be prioritized
    - This can be helpful for creating channels that use commentary tracks
    - External tooling exists to easily update title/name metadata if your audio streams don't already have this metadata
- Add `Amf` hardware acceleration option for AMD GPUs on Windows
- Add `QSV Extra Hardware Frames` parameter for tuning QSV acceleration
  - Performance may improve on some systems after doubling or halving the default value of `64`

## [0.6.6-beta] - 2022-08-17
### Fixed
- Use MIME Type `application/x-mpegurl` for all playlists instead of `application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`
- Replace `setsar` filter with `setdar` filter
  - `setsar` caused issues scaling between two different aspect ratios
    - For example, some 4:3 content would appear stretched when scaled to a 16:9 resolution
  - `setdar` is now only used when aspect ratios match
- Prioritize aspect ratio from container when video stream contains conflicting aspect ratio
  - This is usually caused by bad authoring, but the change should improve scaling behavior for edge cases

### Added
- Support DSD audio file formats (DFF and DSF) in local song libraries
- Support OGG audio file formats (OGG, OPUS, OGA, OGX, SPX) in local song libraries

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fix subtitle stream selection when subtitle language is different than audio language
- Fix bug with unsupported AAC channel layouts
- Fix NVIDIA second-gen maxwell capabilities detection
- Return distinct search results for episodes and other videos that have the same title
  - For example, two other videos both named `Trailer` would previously have displayed as one item in search results
- Fix schedules that would begin to repeat the same content in the same order after a couple of days

### Added
- Add `640x480` resolution

## [0.6.3-beta] - 2022-07-04

- Properly ignore Plex `Other Videos` libraries (`movie` libraries where agent is `com.plexapp.agents.none`)
- Fix `Custom Title` for schedule items with `One`, `Multiple` and `Flood` playout modes
- Fix scheduling bug where flood items would sometimes fail to continue after midnight

### Added
- Add `metadata_kind` field to search index to allow searching for items with a particular metdata source
  - Valid metadata kinds are `fallback`, `sidecar` (NFO), `external` (from a media server) and `embedded` (songs)
- Add autocomplete functionality to search bar to quickly navigate to channels, ffmpeg profiles, collections and schedules by name
- Add global setting to skip missing (file-not-found or unavailable) items when building playouts
- Add filler preset option to allow watermarks to overlay on top of filler (disabled by default)
  - This option is applied when new items are added to a playout; rebuilding is needed if you want the change to take effect immediately
- Read `track` field from music video NFO metadata and use it for chronological sorting (after release date)
- Add `Random Start Point` option to schedules
  - When this option is enabled, all `Chronological` or `Shuffle In Order` content groups will have their start points randomized
  - When this option is disabled, all `Chronological` or `Shuffle In Order` content groups will start with the chronologically earliest item

### Changed
- Replace invalid (control) characters in NFO metadata with replacement character `�` before parsing
- Store partial (incomplete) NFO metadata results when invalid XML is encountered
  - Previously, no metadata would be stored if the XML within the NFO failed to validate

## [0.5.6-beta] - 2022-05-06
### Fixed
- Fix processing local movie NFO metadata without a `year` value
- Fix processing local movie fallback metadata

### Fixed
- Fix adding episodes with no title to the search index
  - This behavior was preventing some items from being removed from the trash
- Support combination NFO metadata for movies, shows, artists and music videos
  - Note that ErsatzTV does not scrape any metadata; any URLs after the XML will be ignored
- Fix bug causing some Jellyfin and Emby content to incorrectly show as unavailable
- Fix extracting embedded `mov_text` subtitles
- Properly extract embedded subtitles on playouts where subtitles are only enabled on schedule items (and not on the channel itself)

  - Instead, a new `unavailable` media state will be used to indicate this condition
  - After updating mounts, path replacements, etc - a library scan can be used to resolve this state

## [0.5.2-beta] - 2022-04-22
### Fixed
- Fix unlocking libraries when scanning fails for any reason
- Fix software overlay of actual size watermark

### Added
- Add support for burning in embedded and external text subtitles
  - **This requires a one-time full library scan, which may take a long time with large libraries.**
- Sync Plex, Jellyfin and Emby collections as tags on movies, shows, seasons and episodes
  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:"Collection Name"`
  - Note that Emby has an outstanding collections bug that prevents updates when removing items from a collection
- Sync Plex labels as tags on movies and shows
  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:"Plex Label Name"`
- Add `Deep Scan` button for Plex libraries
  - This scanning mode is *slow* but is required to detect some changes like labels

### Changed
- Improve the speed and change detection of the Plex library scanners

## [0.5.1-beta] - 2022-04-17
### Fixed
- Fix subtitles edge case with NVENC

### Added
- Add `Empty Trash` button to `Trash` page

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2022-04-13
### Fixed
- Fix `HLS Segmenter` bug where it would drift off of the schedule if a playout was changed while the segmenter was running
- Ensure clients that use HDHomeRun emulation (like Plex) always get an `MPEG-TS` stream, regardless of the configured streaming mode
- Fix scheduling bug that caused some days to be skipped when fixed start times were used with fallback filler

### Added
- Add `Preferred Subtitle Language` and `Subtitle Mode` to channel settings
  - `Preferred Subtitle Language` will filter all subtitle streams based on language
  - `Subtitle Mode` will further filter subtitle streams based on attributes (forced, default)

  - Schedule Item
  - Channel
  - Global

### Changed
- Remove legacy transcoder logic option; all channels will use the new transcoder logic
- Renamed channel setting `Preferred Language` to `Preferred Audio Language`
- Reworked playout build logic to maintain collection progress in some scenarios. There are now three build modes:
  - `Continue` - add new items to the end of an existing playout
    - This mode is used when playouts are automatically extended in the background
  - `Refresh` - this mode will try to maintain collection progress while rebuilding the entire playout
    - This mode is used when a schedule is updated, or when collection modifications trigger a playout rebuild
  - `Reset` - this mode will rebuild the entire playout and will NOT maintain progress
    - This mode is only used when the `Reset Playout` button is clicked on the Playouts page
  - **This requires rebuilding all playouts, which will happen on startup after upgrading**
- Use ffmpeg to resize images; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use
- Use ffprobe to check for animated logos and watermarks; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use
- Allow two decimals in channel numbers (e.g. `5.73`)

## [0.4.5-alpha] - 2022-03-29
### Fixed
- Fix streaming mode inconsistencies when `mode` parameter is unspecified
- Fix startup on Windows 7

### Added
- Add option to automatically deinterlace video when transcoding
  - Previously, this was always enabled; the purpose of the option is to allow disabling any deinterlace filters
  - Note that there is no performance gain to disabling the option with progressive content; filters are only ever applied to interlaced content

### Changed
- Change FFmpeg Profile video codec and audio codec text fields to select fields
  - The appropriate video encoder will be determined based on the video format and hardware acceleration selections
- Remove FFmpeg Profile `Transcode`, `Normalize Video` and `Normalize Audio` settings

- Add `album_artist` to song metadata and to search index
- Display `album_artist` on some song videos when it's different than the `artist`

### Changed
- Framerate normalization will never normalize framerate below 24fps
  - Instead, content with a lower framerate will be normalized up to 24fps

  - This is needed because Trakt lists can contain seasons
  - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete

### Fixed
- Fix local television scanner to properly update episode metadata when NFO files have been added/changed
- Properly detect ffmpeg nvenc (cuda) support in Hardware Acceleration health check
- Fix nvenc/cuda filter for some yuv420p content

### Fixed
- Fix docker vaapi support for newer Intel platforms (Gen 8+)
  - This includes a new setting to force a particular vaapi driver (`iHD` or `i965`), as some Gen 8 or 9 hardware that is supported by both drivers will perform better with one or the other
- Fix scanning and indexing local movies and episodes without NFO metadata
- Fix displaying seasons for shows with no year (in metadata or in folder name)
- Fix "direct play" in MPEG-TS mode (copy audio and video stream when `Transcode` is unchecked)

  - Enable HEAD requests for IPTV image paths since Kodi requires those

## [0.0.56-alpha] - 2021-09-10
### Added
- Add Smart Collections
  - Smart Collections use search queries and can be created from the search result page
  - Smart Collections are re-evaluated every time playouts are extended or rebuilt to automatically include newly-matching items
  - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete
- Allow `Shuffle In Order` with Collections and Smart Collections
  - Episodes will be grouped by show, and music videos will be grouped by artist
  - All movies will be a single group (multi-collections are probably better if `Shuffle In Order` is desired for movies)

  - This is useful for randomizing multiple collections/shows on a single channel, while each collection maintains proper ordering (custom or chronological)

### Fixed
- Fix bug parsing ffprobe output in cultures where `.` is a group/thousands separator
  - This bug likely prevented ETV from scheduling correctly or working at all in those cultures
  - After installing a version with this fix, affected content will need to be removed from ETV and re-added
