# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add new collection type `Rerun Collection`
  - This collection type will show up as *two* collection types in classic schedules
    - `Rerun (First Run)`
    - `Rerun (Rerun)`
  - The playback order for each of these collection types can be set on the rerun collection itself
    - e.g. `Season, Episode` order for first run, `Shuffle` for rerun
  - When a first run item is added to a playout, it will immediately be made available in the rerun collection
  - Rerun history is currently scoped to the playout, and only supported in classic schedules
    - This means resetting the playout will reset the rerun history
  - Items will still be scheduled from the rerun collection if it is used before the first run collection
    - Otherwise, the rerun collection would be considered "empty" which prevents the playout build altogether
- Add `Rkmpp` hardware acceleration by @peterdey
  - This is supported using jellyfin-ffmpeg7 on devices like Orange Pi 5 Plus and NanoPi R6S
- Block schedules: allow selecting multiple watermarks on block items
- Block schedules: allow selecting multiple graphics elements on block items
- Add `motion` graphics element type
  - Supported in playback troubleshooting and all scheduling types
  - Supports video files with alpha channel (e.g. vp8/vp9 webm, apple prores 4444)
  - Supports EPG and Media Item replacement in entire template
    - EPG data is sourced from XMLTV for the current time
      - EPG data can also load a configurable number of subsequent (up next) entries
    - Media Item data is sourced from the currently playing media item
  - Template supports:
    - Content (`video_path`)
    - Placement (`location`, `horizontal_margin_percent`, `vertical_margin_percent`)
    - Scaling (`scale`, `scale_width_percent`)
    - Timing (`start_seconds`)
    - End behavior (`end_behavior`)
      - `disappear` (default) - disappear after playing once
      - `loop` - loop forever
      - `hold` - hold last frame forever, or `hold_seconds`
    - Draw order (`z_index`)
- Add search fields to filter collections, schedules and playouts tables
- Add selected row background color to schedules and playouts tables
- Graphics engine text element: add `width_percent` and `text_fit` to support wrapping and scaling text
  - `text_fit: none` or unspecified will keep existing behavior (render text exactly as configured)
  - `text_fit: wrap` will wrap text to the given `width_percent`
  - `text_fit: scale` will scale text *smaller* to fit the given `width_percent`
    - Text that already fits with the configured style will not be adjusted
- Block schedules: add **experimental** `Break Content` to decos
  - Break content is similar to filler from classic schedules
  - Break content is currently limited to placement `Block Start` (play before anything else in the block)
    - Future work will add other placement options
  - Break content is currently limited to playlists (which do *not* pad - they simply play through the playlist one time)
    - Future work will add other collection options which will pad to the full block duration

### Fixed
- Fix green output when libplacebo tonemapping is used with NVIDIA acceleration and 10-bit output in FFmpeg Profile
- Fix playback when invalid video preset has been saved in FFmpegProfile
  - This can happen when NVIDIA accel falls back to libx264 software encoder for 10-bit h264 output
- Fix 10-bit output when using NVIDIA and graphics engine (watermark or other overlays)
- Fix playback of Jellyfin content with unknown color range
- Block schedules: skip collections (block items) that will never fit in block duration
- Block schedules: skip media items that will never fit in block duration
- Fix HLS playlist generation for clients that actually care about discontinuities (like hls.js)
  - This should resolve most playback issues with built-in channel preview
- Fix deco dead air fallback selection and duration on mirror channels
- Fix fallback filler duration on mirror channels
- Fix slow startup caused by check for overlapping playout items
- Fix green line in *most* cases when overlaying content using NVIDIA acceleration

### Changed
- Filler presets: use separate text fields for `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds` duration
- Use autocomplete fields for collection searching in deco editor
  - This greatly improves the editor performance

## [25.6.0] - 2025-09-14
### Added
- Classic schedules: allow selecting multiple graphics elements on schedule items
- Block schedules: allow selecting multiple graphics elements on decos
- Add channel `Playout Source` setting
  - `Generated`: default/existing behavior where channel must have its own playout
  - `Mirror`: channel will play content from the specified `Mirror Source Channel`'s playout
    - This allows the exact same content on different channels with different channel settings
    - `Playout Offset` can be used to offset the times of scheduled playout items from the mirror source channel
      - e.g. -2 hours will cause the mirror channel to play content 2 hours before the mirror source channel
- Add support for `.aif`, `.aifc`, `.aiff` song files
- Classic schedules: add playback order `Marathon`
  - This can be used with collections and smart collections
  - Items from the collection will be grouped by the `Marathon Group By` setting: `Artist`, `Album`, `Season` or `Show`
  - The order of groups can optionally be shuffled
  - The order of items in each group can optionally be shuffled (otherwise `Season, Episode` or `Chronological` as appropriate)
  - A batch size can be set to limit the number of items to schedule from each group at a time
    - Empty or zero batch size means play all items from each group before advancing
    - Any other value means play the specified number of items before advancing to the next group
- Log API requests when `Request Logging Minimum Log Level` is set to `Debug`
- Add `Count` setting to each playlist item
  - Previously, when `Play All` was unchecked, this was implicitly 1
  - Now, the playlist can play a specific number of items from the collection before moving to the next playlist item
- Classic schedules: add `Shuffle Playlist Items` setting to shuffle the order of playlist items
  - Shuffling happens initially (on playout reset), and after all items from the *entire playlist* have been played
- Add playout detail row coloring by @peterdey
  - Filler has unique row colors
  - Unscheduled gaps are now displayed and have a unique row color
- Process entire graphics element YAML files using scriban
  - This allows things like different images based on `MediaItem_ContentRating` (movie) or `MediaItem_ShowContentRating` (episode)
- Playlists: add playback order `Shuffle In Order` for collections and smart collections

### Fixed
- Fix transcoding content with bt709/pc color metadata
- Fix scripted schedule validation (file exists) when creating or editing playout
- Fix adding single episode, movie, season, show to empty playlists
- Fix startup with MySql as non-superuser
  - `local_infile=ON` is required when using MySQL (for bulk inserts when building playouts)
  - ETV will set this automatically when it has permission
  - When ETV does not have permission, startup will fail with logged instructions on how to configure MySql
- Fix scaling anamorphic content in locales that don't use period as a decimal separator (e.g. `,`)
- Block schedules: fix playout build crash when empty collection uses random playback order
- Fix watermarks and graphics elements on primary content split by mid-roll filler
- Fix watermarks and graphics elements when `Scaling Behavior` is `Crop`
- Fix hardware acceleration health check message on mobile
- Fix deco selection logic
- Fix inefficient database migration that would cause database initialization to get stuck
- Classic schedules: fix scheduling behavior when a flood item is before a flexible fixed start item
  - Sometimes the flood item wouldn't schedule anything
- Fix troubleshooting certain text graphics elements by generating fake EPG data

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: change how `Scripted Schedule` system works
  - No longer uses embedded python (IronPython); instead uses HTTP API
  - OpenAPI Description has been added at `/openapi/scripted-schedule.json`
    - This allows scripted scheduling from *many* languages
  - The scripted schedule file must now be directly executable (though a wrapper can be used to load a venv)
  - The scripted schedule file will be passed the following arguments (in order):
    - The API host (e.g. `http://localhost:8409`)
    - The build id (a UUID string that is required on all API calls)
    - The playout build mode (e.g. `reset` or `continue`, normally only used for specific logic when resetting a playout)
  - Custom arguments can be included in the `Scripted Schedule` field in the playout editor
    - Custom arguments will be passed *after* required arguments
    - For example, a `Scripted Schedule` of `/home/jason/schedule.sh "party central" 23` will be executed like
      - `/home/jason/schedule.sh http://localhost:8409 00000000-0000...0000 reset "party central" 23`
    - This enables wrapper script re-use across multiple scripted schedules
  - API reference is available at `/docs`
  - Docker images contain pre-generated python api client and entrypoint script
    - Entrypoint is at `/app/scripted-schedules/entrypoint.py`
    - Scripts folder should be mounted to `/app/scripted-schedules/scripts`
    - Playouts should be created with scripted schedule `/app/scripted-schedules/entrypoint.py script-name` (no trailing `.py`)
- Automatically ignore Specials/Season 0 when using `Season, Episode` playback order

## [25.5.0] - 2025-09-01
### Added
- Add *experimental* graphics engine
  - All watermarks will use new graphics engine
- Add `Opacity Expression` watermark mode
  - This allows specifying an expression that returns an opacity between 0.0 and 1.0
  - The expression can use:
    - `content_seconds` - the total number of seconds the frame is into the content
    - `content_total_seconds` - the total number of seconds in the content
    - `channel_seconds` - the total number of seconds the frame is from when the channel started/activated
    - `time_of_day_seconds` - the total number of seconds the frame is since midnight
  - The expression can also use functions:
    - `LinearFadeDuration(time, start, fadeSeconds, peakSeconds)`
    - `LinearFadePoints(time, start, peakStart, peakEnd, end)`
- Add `Z-Index` to watermark editor
  - The graphics engine will order by z-index when overlaying watermarks
- Add *experimental* `Graphics Element` template system
  - Graphics elements are defined in YAML files inside ETV config folder / templates / graphics-elements subfolder
  - Add `text` graphics element type
    - Supported in playback troubleshooting and YAML playouts
    - Displays multi-line text in a specified font, color, location, z-index
    - Supports constant opacity and opacity expression
    - Supports EPG and Media Item variable replacement
      - EPG data is sourced from XMLTV for the current time
        - EPG data can also load a configurable number of subsequent (up next) entries
      - Media Item data is sourced from the currently playing media item
  - Add `image` graphics element type
    - Supported in playback troubleshooting and YAML playouts
    - Displays an image, similar to a watermark
    - Supports constant opacity and opacity expression
  - Add `subtitle` graphics element type
    - Supported in playback troubleshooting and YAML playouts
    - Supports SRT and SSA/ASS subtitle formats
    - Supports EPG and Media Item variable replacement
      - EPG data is sourced from XMLTV for the current time
        - EPG data can also load a configurable number of subsequent (up next) entries
      - Media Item data is sourced from the currently playing media item
- YAML playout: add `graphics_on` and `graphics_off` instructions to control graphics elements
  - `graphics_on` requires the name of a graphics element template, e.g. `text/cool_element.yml`
    - The `variables` property can be used to dynamically replace text from the template
  - `graphics_off` will turn off a specific element, or all elements if none are specified
- Add `Seek Seconds` to playback troubleshooting to support capturing timing-related issues
- Custom stream selector: add `content_condition` to allow channel and time-of-day based decisions
  - `content_condition` expression can use
    - `channel_number`
    - `channel_name`
    - `time_of_day_seconds` - the start time for the current item, represented in seconds since midnight
- Add support for external chapter files next to video files
  - Currently supports Matroska Chapter XML format
    - Chapter files have .xml or .chapters extension
- Add targeted (single-show) library scanning
  - Supports quick and deep scans
  - Can be triggered from the `Scan` button on show pages
  - Can be triggered by API call to `/api/libraries/{library-id}/scan-show`
- Add XMLTV setting `XMLTV Block Behavior` to control how block schedules appear in the EPG
  - `Split Time Evenly` - default (existing) behavior; block time is split among all items that are visible in the EPG
  - `Use Actual Times` - actual times are used for all items that are visible in the EPG
    - This will introduce EPG gaps when filler is used, or when items are hidden from the EPG
- Add *experimental* `Scripted Schedule` playout system
  - This system uses python scripts to support the highest degree of customization
  - The goal is to expose methods equivalent to all sequential schedule (YAML) instructions
- YAML and Scripted schedules: add `offline_tail` and `stop_before_end` to `pad_to_next` instruction
  - Both parameters default to `true`

### Fix
- Fix database operations that were slowing down playout builds
  - YAML playouts in particular should build significantly faster
- Fix channel playout mode `On Demand` for Block and YAML schedules
- Fix QSV transitions when remote streaming from a media server
- Fix green output when padding with VAAPI accel and i965 driver
- Fix watermark custom image validation
- Fix playback when using any watermarks that were saved with invalid state (no image)
- Fix overlapping block playout items caused by `Stop scheduling block items` value `After Duration End`
  - Existing overlapping items will not be removed, but no new overlapping items will be created
  - Until these existing items age out, there will be warnings logged after each playout build/extension
- Fix playback of anamorphic content from Jellyfin
  - This fix requires a manual deep scan of any affected Jellyfin library
- Fix bug where multiple Plex servers would mix their episodes
- Fix incorrect media item counts after removing paths from local libraries
- Fix song playback in playback troubleshooting
- Fix seeking into extracted text subtitles
- Fix error when changing default (lowest priority) alternate schedule
- Fix remote library editing, tv shows, artists with MySql/MariaDB
- Classic schedules: fix alternate schedule transitions (some edge cases would cause days to be skipped completely)
- Classic schedules: always start new alternate schedules with the first schedule item
- Classic Schedules: log offline gaps longer than 1 hour due to strict fixed start times
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` streaming mode with AMF acceleration
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` streaming mode with VideoToolbox acceleration
- Fix startup process for database and search index initialization
  - Redirect all pages to home page when initializing to prevent errors
  - Clear stale sqlite migration lock on startup to prevent getting stuck on database initialization
- Fix display of long season placeholder text (when season posters are unavailable)

### Changed
- Rename some schedule and playout terms for clarity
  - Schedules are used to build playouts and are what actually differs
  - The playout is the end result, and is the same no matter what schedule kind is used
  - Supported schedule kinds:
    - `Classic Schedules`
    - `Block Schedules`
    - `Sequential Schedules` (formerly `YAML Schedules` or `YAML Playouts`)
    - `Scripted Schedules`
    - `JSON (dizqueTV) Schedules` (formerly `External JSON Playouts`)
- Allow multiple watermarks in playback troubleshooting
- Classic schedules: allow selecting multiple watermarks on schedule items
- Block schedules: allow selecting multiple watermarks on decos
- Block schedules: change available watermark modes on decos. For reference, the levels from highest to lowest with block schedules are `Global` > `Channel` > `Playout Default Deco` > `Template Deco`.
  - `Inherit` - Use watermarks configured at a higher level
  - `Disable` - Disable watermarks at this level and above
  - `Replace` - Replace all watermarks configured at a higher level with those on this deco
    - This was renamed from `Override`
  - `Merge` - Merge all watermarks configured at a higher level with those on this deco
- YAML playout: `watermark` instruction changes:
  - When value is `true`, will add named watermark to list of active watermarks
  - When value is `false` and `name` is specified, will remove named watermark from list of active watermarks
  - When value is `false` and `name` is not specified, will clear all active watermarks
- Use consistent UI sorting and validation, and fix renaming errors for
  - Block groups, blocks
  - Template groups, templates
  - Deco groups, decos
  - Deco template groups, deco templates

## [25.4.0] - 2025-08-05
### Added
- Add `Troubleshoot Playback` to overflow menu on all media cards
  - This should eliminate the need to lookup media ids for content
- Add subtitle selection to playback troubleshooting. This is limited to:
  - Sidecar text subtitles (e.g. `srt` files)
  - Embedded image subtitles
  - Embedded text subtitles that have already been extracted by ETV
- Add light mode and light/dark mode toggle to app bar
- YAML playout: add `pre_roll` instruction to enable and disable a pre-roll sequence
  - With value of `true` and `sequence` property, will enable automatic pre-roll for all content in the playout to the sequence with the provided key
  - With value of `false`, will disable automatic pre-roll in the playout
- YAML playout: add `post_roll` instruction to enable and disable a post-roll sequence
  - With value of `true` and `sequence` property, will enable automatic post-roll for all content in the playout to the sequence with the provided key
  - With value of `false`, will disable automatic post-roll in the playout
- YAML playout: add `mid_roll` instruction to enable and disable a mid-roll sequence
  - With value of `true` and `sequence` property, will enable automatic mid-roll for (`count` and `all`) content in the playout to the sequence with the provided key
  - With value of `false`, will disable automatic post-roll in the playout
  - `expression` can be used to influence which chapters are selected for mid roll (same as in filler preset)
- YAML playout: add `rewind` instruction to set start of playout relative to the current time
  - Value should be formatted as `HH:MM:SS` e.g. `00:05:30` for 5 minutes 30 seconds (before now)
  - This is instruction is mostly useful for debugging transitions, and can only be used as a reset instruction
- YAML playout: add `import` section to allow importing partial YAML definitions that include `content` and `sequence` entries
- Add YAML playout validation (using JSON Schema)
  - Invalid YAML playout definitions will fail to build and will log validation failures as warnings
  - `content` is fully validated
  - `sequence` is fully validated
  - `reset` is fully validated
  - `playout` is fully validated
- Add `Playlist` collection type to filler presets
  - This will force filler mode `Count`
  - Whenever the filler is used, it will schedule `Count` times full time through the playlist
    - If the playlist has 3 items and none set to play all, it will schedule 3 items when `Count = 1`
    - If the playlist has 3 items and none set to play all, it will schedule 6 items when `Count = 2`
  - Using the same playlist in the same schedule for anything other than filler may cause undesired behavior
- Detect supported VideoToolbox hardware decoders and encoders
  - Software decoders/encoders will automatically be used when hardware versions are unavailable
- Add VideoToolbox Capabilities to Troubleshooting page
- Add `Use Chapters As Media Items` option to filler preset
  - This option allows scheduling individual chapters as filler
  - The chapters are shuffled or otherwise sorted together just like normal filler would be
- Add smart collection edit page to allow renaming smart collections
  - Previous edit link behavior (performing search using smart collection query) now uses magnifying glass icon
- Add channel `Transcode Mode` setting
  - This setting is currently disabled and only has the value `On Demand`
- Add channel `Idle Behavior` setting to control the transcoding behavior after all clients have disconnected
  - `Stop On Disconnect` - stops the transcoder after all clients have disconnected + the global idle timeout
  - `Keep Running` - transcoder will run until manually stopped
- Add support for music video thumbnails that end in `-thumb`
  - For example `Music Video.mkv` could have a corresponding thumbnail `Music Video-thumb.jpg`
- Reorganize troubleshooting page
  - Add `YAML Validation` tool in `Troubleshooting` > `Tools`

### Fixed
- Fix app startup with MySql/MariaDB
- YAML playout: fix `pad_to_next` always running over time
- Fix playback with text subtitles when seeking into content, i.e. when first joining a channel
- Fix playback with `.ass` and `.ssa` text subtitles
- Fix green padding with 10-bit source content and i965 VAAPI driver
- Fix building playouts with empty schedules
- Fix schedule start time calculation when daily playout build goes beyond midnight and into a different alternate schedule
- Fix compatibility with older NVIDIA devices (compute capability 3.0+) in unified docker image
- Fix transitions when using NVIDIA, QSV and VAAPI acceleration
- Fix playback of remote streams on channels where framerate normalization is enabled

### Changed
- Always tell ffmpeg to stop encoding with a specific duration
  - This was removed to try to improve transitions with ffmpeg 7.x, but has been causing issues with other content
- Move search debug logging to its own log category; add `Searching Minimum Log Level` to `Settings` > `Logging`
- Classic schedules: always schedule the full `Duration` amount instead of stopping mid-duration
  - This allows duration items to be scheduled beyond midnight
  - e.g. fixed start time 22:00 with 4 hour duration will schedule until 02:00 instead of stopping at midnight
- Rename channel setting `Progress Mode` to `Playout Mode`
  - This controls the progression of the channel's playout, and has nothing to do with transcoding
  - `Always` is now called `Continuous` (playout progresses with wall clock)
  - `On Demand` is unchanged (playout only progresses while a client is watching the channel)
- Replace channel `Active Mode` setting with new `Is Enabled` and `Show In EPG` settings
  - `Active` channels will be converted to `Is Enabled` = true and `Show In EPG` = true
  - `Hidden` channels will be converted to `Is Enabled` = true and `Show In EPG` = false
  - `Inactive` channels will be converted to `Is Enabled` = false and `Show In EPG` = false

## [25.3.1] - 2025-07-24
### Fixed
- Fix fallback filler playback

## [25.3.0] - 2025-07-24
### Added
- Add new channel stream (audio and subtitle) selector system
  - Channel editor has a new field `Stream Selector Mode`
    - `Default` maintains existing behavior
    - `Custom` uses a YAML config file
  - The YAML config contains a prioritized list of stream selector "items" (audio and subtitle criteria pairs)
  - The items are tested against the media from top to bottom, and when (at least) a matching audio track is found, stream selection occurs
  - As an example, the custom stream selector config can specify (in priority order):
    - english audio (and disable subtitles)
    - any other audio (and english subtitles, if they exist)
  - Criteria can include
    - Stream language
    - Stream title (allowed title and/or blocked title)
    - Stream condition, which is an expression that can use
      - `id` (index)
      - `title`
      - `lang`
      - `default`
      - `forced`
      - `sdh` (subtitle only)
      - `external` (subtitle only)
      - `codec`
      - `channels` (audio only)
    - An example subtitle condition: `lang like 'en%' and external`
    - An example audio condition: `title like '%movie%' and channels > 2`
- Add new channel setting `Active Mode`
  - `Active` - default value, channel streams as normal and has normal visibility
  - `Hidden` - channel streams as normal and is hidden from M3U/XMLTV/HDHR
  - `Inactive` - channel cannot stream (will 404) and is hidden from M3U/XMLTV/HDHR
- Synchronize Plex "network" metadata for Plex show libraries
  - Shows will have new `network` search field
  - Episodes will have new `show_network` search field
- YAML playout: add `stop_before_end` setting to `pad_until` and `duration` instructions
  - When `stop_before_end: false`, content can run over the desired time before executing the next instruction
- YAML playout: add `offline_tail` setting to `pad_until` instruction
  - This can be used to stop primary content before the desired time (`stop_before_end: true` and `offline_tail: false`)
  - You can then have a second `pad_until` with the same target time and different content
- YAML playout: make `tomorrow` an expression on `pad_until` instruction
  - `true` and `false` still work as normal
  - The current time (as a decimal) can also be used in the expression, e.g. `now > 23`
    - `now = hours + minutes / 60.0 + seconds / 3600.0`
    - So `10:30 AM` would be `10.5`, `10:45 PM` would be `22.75`, etc
- YAML playout: make `skip_items` an expression
  - The following parameters can be used:
    - `count`: the total number of items in the content
    - `random`: a random number between zero and (count - 1)
  - For example:
    - `count / 2` will start in the middle of the content
    - `random` will start at a random point in the content
    - `2` (similar to before this change) will skip the first two items in the content
- YAML playout: make `count` an expression
    - The following parameters can be used:
        - `count`: the total number of items in the content
        - `random`: a random number between zero and (count - 1)
    - For example:
        - `count / 2` will play half of the items in the content
        - `random % 4 + 1` will play between 1 and 4 items
        - `2` (similar to before this change) will play exactly two items
- YAML playout: add `disable_watermarks` property to all content instructions
  - This property defaults to `false` (meaning watermarks are allowed by default)
  - Setting to `true` will prevent watermarks from ever appearing over the content
- YAML playout: add `watermark` instruction
  - With value of `true` and `name` property, will override the watermark in the playout to the watermark with the provided name
  - With value of `false`, will restore default watermark value (channel watermark, global watermark)
- Show health check warning and error badges in nav menu
- Add `Expression` for mid-roll filler to allow custom logic for using or skipping chapter markers
  - The following parameters can be used:
    - `total_points`: total number of potential mid-roll points
    - `matched_points`: number of mid-roll points that have already matched the expression
    - `total_duration`: total duration of the content, in seconds
    - `total_progress`: normalized position from 0 to 1
    - `last_mid_filler`: seconds since last mid-roll filler
    - `remaining_duration`: duration of the content after this mid-roll point, in seconds
    - `point`: the position of the mid-roll point, in seconds
    - `num`: the mid-roll point number, starting with 1
- Add `Disable Watermarks` checkbox to block items
  - Block items that have this checked will never display a watermark, even with Deco set to override watermark
- Add `ETV_MAXIMUM_UPLOAD_MB` environment variable to allow uploading large watermarks
  - Default value is 10
- Update ffmpeg health check to link to ErsatzTV-FFmpeg release that contains binaries for win64, linux64, linuxarm64
- Add `Playback Troubleshooting` page
  - This tool lets you play specific content without needing a test channel or schedule
  - You can specify
    - The media item id (found in ETV media info, and ETV movie URLs)
    - The ffmpeg profile to use
    - The watermark to use (if any)
  - Clicking `Play` will play up to 30 seconds of the specified content using the desired settings
  - Clicking `Download Results` will generate a zip archive containing:
    - The FFmpeg report of the playback attempt
    - The media info for the content
    - The `Troubleshooting` > `General` output
- Support `(Part [english number])` name suffixes for multi-part episode grouping, for example:
  - `Awesome Episode (Part One)`
  - `Better Episode (Part Two)`
  - `Not So Great (Part Three)`
- Add Trakt List option `Auto Refresh` to automatically update list from trakt.tv once each day
- Add Trakt List option `Generate Playlist` to automatically generate ETV Playlist from matched Trakt List items
- Read `country` field from movie NFO files and include in search index as `country`
- Add *experimental* and *incomplete* `Remote Stream` library kind
    - Remote Stream libraries have fallback metadata added like Other Video libraries (every folder is a tag)
    - Remote Stream library items consist of YAML (`.yml`) files with the following fields
      - `url`: the URL of the content that can be played directly by ffmpeg
      - `script`: the process name and arguments for a command that will output content to stdout
      - `is_live`: *required* property that indicates whether the remote stream contains live content
          - When this is set to `true`, ETV cannot work ahead on transcoding this item, which is a necessary tradeoff for supporting live content
          - When this is set to `false`, ETV will treat the stream as VOD and attempt to work ahead on transcoding like any other local item
              - This *will* cause errors when the content is actually live, so it's important to configure this correctly
      - `duration`: when the content is live and does not have duration metadata, this must be provided to allow scheduling
    - The remote stream definition (YAML file) may provide either a `url` or a `script`
      - If both are provided, `url` will be used
- Include number of chapters in search index as `chapters`

### Changed
- Allow `Other Video` libraries and `Image` libraries to use the same folders
- Try to mitigate inotify limit error by disabling automatic reloading of `appsettings.json` config files
- Support `movie`, `musicvideo` and `episodedetails` top-level tags in other video NFO files
  - Note that no change has been made to the metadata tags that are actually parsed, but this should help with various types of content
- Remove some limits on multithreading that are no longer needed with latest ffmpeg
  - Mixed transcoding (software decode, hardware filters/encode) can now use multiple decode threads
- Split main `Settings` page into multiple pages
- Update UI layout on all pages to be less cramped and to work better on mobile
- Add CPU and Video Controller info to `Troubleshooting` > `General` output
- Enable write-ahead logging (WAL) mode on SQLite databases
- Add `Multiple Mode` option to schedule items editor and remove support for count values of zero
  - `Count`: same behavior as before, requires a number of media items to play and will always schedule the same number
  - `Collection Size`: similar to count of zero before, will play all media items from the collection before continuing to the next schedule item
  - `Playlist Item Size`: will play all media items from the current playlist item before continuing to the next schedule item
  - `Multi-Episode Group Size`: will play all media items from the current multi-part episode group, or one ungrouped media item
- Change watermark width and margins to allow decimals
- Move `Add To Collection` button to overflow menu on all media cards, and add `Show Media Info` to overflow menu
  - This allows showing media info for all media kinds
- Unify on a multi-platform base docker tag (`latest` and `develop`)
  - `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7` platforms are now all supported in the base docker tag
  - Other docker platform tags are deprecated and will receive no new updates after the next release
  - A health check has been added to notify users (on `-arm` or `-arm64` tags) of this change

### Fixed
- Fix QSV acceleration in docker with older Intel devices
- Fix HDR transcoding with NVIDIA accel for:
    - All NVIDIA docker users
    - Windows NVIDIA users who have set the `ETV_DISABLE_VULKAN` env var
- Fix audio sync issue with QSV acceleration
- YAML playout: fix history for marathon and playlist content
  - This allows playouts to be extended correctly, instead of always resetting to the earliest item in each group
- Fix using channel External Logo URL as watermark
- Fix display of SVG channel logo and watermark in admin UI
  - Existing SVG logos and watermarks will have to be re-uploaded to display properly in the admin UI
  - This does not affect streaming at all; existing artwork still works fine for streaming
- Classify HDHR endpoints as streaming endpoints
  - This allows these endpoints to be accessed through port `ETV_STREAMING_PORT` (default `8409`)
  - This only matters if you configured `ETV_UI_PORT` to be a different value, which makes UI endpoints inaccessible on the streaming port
- Update Plex movie/other video plot ("summary") during library deep scan
- Fix compatibility with ffmpeg 7.2+ when using NVIDIA accel and 10-bit source content
- Fix some NVIDIA edge cases when media servers don't provide video bit depth information
- Fix VAAPI tonemap failure
- Fix green bars after VAAPI tonemap
- Fix bug where playout mode `Multiple` would ignore fixed start time
- Fix block playout EPG generation to use `XMLTV Time Zone` setting
- Fix adding "official" Trakt lists
- Fix searching for `collection` names with spaces or other special characters, e.g. `collection:"Movies - Action"`
- Fix QSV transcoding errors when scaling
- Fix QSV frame freezing in browser
- Fix some stream continuity issues, and some cases where audio sync is lost at transition
- Fix HDR transcoding with AMD VAAPI accel
- Allow paths longer than 255 characters in MySql databases

## [25.2.0] - 2025-06-24
### Added
- Add `linux-musl-x64` artifact for users running Alpine x64
- Add API endpoint to empty trash (POST to `/api/maintenance/empty_trash`)
  - e.g. `curl -XPOST -d '' http://localhost:8409/api/maintenance/empty_trash`
- Add remote IP and user agent to HTTP request logging
- Add environment variables to allow ETV to run UI and streaming on separate ports
    - `ETV_STREAMING_PORT`: port used for streaming requests, defaults to 8409
    - `ETV_UI_PORT`: port used for admin UI, defaults to 8409
- Publish docker images to ghcr.io (`ghcr.io/ersatztv/ersatztv`)
- Add new option `Fixed Start Time Behavior` to Schedules and Schedule Items
  - Schedules can set a default behavior for all items
  - Schedule items can override this default behavior
  - Possible values are:
    - `Strict`: Always wait for the exact start time, even if that means waiting (adding unscheduled time) until the next day
    - `Flexible`: Start scheduling immediately (do not wait) if waiting (adding unscheduled time) would go into the next day
  - As an example, if the current scheduling time is 6:02 AM and the next schedule item has a fixed start time of 6:00 AM
    - `Strict` will add nearly 24h (23:58) of unscheduled time so that it can start exactly at 6:00 AM the next day
    - `Flexible` will NOT add unscheduled time, and will schedule its item at 6:02 AM (which may also affect the scheduling of later items)
- Add basic HDR transcoding support
  - VAAPI may use hardware-accelerated tone mapping (when opencl accel is also available)
  - NVIDIA may use hardware-accelerated tone mapping (when vulkan accel and libplacebo filter are also available)
  - QSV may use hardware-accelerated tone mapping (when hardware decoding is used)
  - In all other cases, HDR content will use a software pipeline
  - The tonemap algorithm can be configured in the ffmpeg profile
- Use hardware-accelerated padding with VAAPI
- Add environment variable `ETV_DISABLE_VULKAN`
  - Any non-empty value will disable use of Vulkan acceleration and force software tonemapping
  - This may be needed with misbehaving NVIDIA drivers on Windows
- Add health check error when invalid VAAPI device and VAAPI driver combination is used in an active ffmpeg profile
  - This makes it obvious when hardware acceleration will not work as configured
- Add button in schedule editor to clone schedule item
- Allow YAML playout sequence definitions to reference other sequences
  - Cycles will be detected and logged, and sequences with cycles will prevent the playout from building
- Add `repeat` property to YAML sequence instruction
  - This tells the playout builder how many times this sequence should repeat
  - Omitting this value is the same as setting it to `1`
- Add `collection` (name) to search index for manual collections created within ETV
  - Collections synchronized from media servers are still indexed as `tag`
- Allow searching by `smart_collection` (name)
  - Quotes are *always* required around each collection name when using this feature
    - e.g. `smart_collection:"one" OR smart_collection:"two"`
  - Cycles will be detected and logged, and searches with cycles will not work as expected
- Add all `ETV_*` environment variables to Troubleshooting > General info
- Add `External Logo URL` field to channel editor
  - Using external (public) logos should fix channel logo display for clients that don't proxy artwork (such as Plex)
  - Users who have customized the XMLTV channel template `channel.sbntxt` will need to update their templates again
    - This is because the templates require different logic for external URLs vs ETV-hosted URLs

### Changed
- Start to make UI minimally responsive (functional on smaller screens)
- Change how ETV determines which address to use for Plex connections
  - The active Plex connection (address) will only be cached for 30 seconds
  - When the connection is no longer cached, a ping will be sent to the last used address for Plex (the last address that had a successful ping)
  - If the ping is successful, the address will be cached for another 30 seconds
  - If the ping is not successful, all addresses will be checked again, and the first address to return a successful ping will be cached for 30 seconds
- Remove requirement to have Jellyfin admin user; user id is no longer required on requests to latest Jellyfin server
- Upgrade bundled ffmpeg on Windows from 6.1 to 7.1.1
- Upgrade VAAPI docker image Ubuntu base from 22 to 24; bundled ffmpeg from 6.1 to 7.1.1
- Upgrade NVIDIA docker image Ubuntu base from 20 to 24; bundled ffmpeg from 6.1 to 7.1.1
- Upgrade base, arm, arm64 docker images bundled ffmpeg from 6.1 to 7.1.1
- Unify all hardware acceleration methods in base docker images (`latest` and `develop`)
  - VAAPI, QSV and NVIDIA are now all supported in the base docker image
  - Other docker image tags are deprecated and will receive no new updates after the next release
  - A health check has been added to notify users (on `-vaapi` or `-nvidia` tags) of this change
- Schedule items editor: show currently selected row using background color instead of font weight

### Fixed
- Fix error message about synchronizing Plex collections from a Plex server that has zero collections
- Fix navigation after form submission when using `ETV_BASE_URL` environment variable
- Fix UI crashes when channel numbers contain a period `.` in locales that have a different decimal separator (e.g. `,`)
- Fix playout detail table to only reload once when resetting a playout
- Fix date formatting in playout detail table on reload (will now respect browser's `Accept-Language` header)
- Use cache busting to avoid UI errors after upgrading the MudBlazor library
- Fix multi-variant playlist to report more accurate `BANDWIDTH` value based on ffmpeg profile
- Fix detecting NVIDIA capabilities on Blackwell GPUs
- Fix decoder selection in NVIDIA pipeline
- Prevent playback order `Shuffle In Order` from being used with `Fill With Group Mode` as they are incompatible
- Fix XMLTV items not grouping properly (guide mode: `Filler`) due to post-roll filler

## [25.1.0] - 2025-01-10
### Added
- Add `Reset All Playouts` button to top of playouts page
- Add `rewind_on_reset` option to `wait_until` YAML playout instruction
  - This option allows YAML playouts to start in the past
- Add `advance` option to `epg_group` YAML playout instruction
  - When set to `false`, this option will lock the guide group without starting a new guide group
  - This can be helpful for "post roll" items that should be part of the previous item's guide group
- Add `Song Video Mode` to channel settings
  - `Default` - existing behavior
  - `With Progress` - show animated progress bar at bottom of generated video
    - Thanks to @JeckDev for the idea and the artwork
- Add fallback album art image for songs that have no album art
- Add `Vaapi Display` option to FFmpeg Profile
  - Possible values will be install-specific and sourced from `vainfo`
  - `drm` was the previous default value, and should be used in most cases
- Test all `Vaapi Display` values in `Troubleshooting` > `VAAPI Capabilities`
- Add `tag_full` field to search index
  - This field contains the same values as the existing `tag` field, but it is not analyzed or tokenized

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Change channel identifiers used in XMLTV to work around bad behavior in Plex

### Fixed
- Fix startup error with MySql backend caused by database cleaner
- Fix emptying trash with ElasticSearch backend
- Fix double loading of trash UI elements, and fix reloading of all UI elements after emptying trash
- Fix destroying channel preview player when preview dialog is closed
  - This bug made it difficult to "stop" a channel after previewing it
- Fix bug where deco default filler would never use hardware acceleration
- Fix deleting local libraries with MySql backend
- Fix `Scaling Behavior` `Crop` when content is smaller than FFmpeg Profile resolution
  - Now, content will properly scale beyond the desired resolution before cropping
- Fix displaying playout item durations that are greater than 24 hours
- Fix building playouts when playlist has been changed to have fewer items
- Fix selecting audio stream with preferred title
- Fix synchronizing Plex collections
  - If this breaks collection sync for you, you will need to update your Plex server
- Fix guide group generation for `duration` YAML instructions
- Fix default song background when targeting 4:3 resolutions
  - Previously the background was always 16:9 and was padded, now it will fill 4:3

## [0.8.8-beta] - 2024-09-19
### Added
- Add support for Plex Other Video libraries
  - These libraries will now appear as ETV Other Video libraries
  - Items in these libraries will have tag metadata added from folders just like local Other Video libraries
  - Thanks @raknam for adding this feature!
- Add *experimental* support for `On Demand` channel progress
  - With `On Demand` channel progress, the playout will only advance when the channel is being streamed
  - When the channel is idle, the playout is unmodified and will be shifted forward as needed so no content is missed
  - Setting a channel to `On Demand` progress will disable alternate schedules
  - The `On Demand` setting will only be used for `Flood` playouts (NOT `Block` or `External JSON`)
  - It is NOT recommended to use fixed start times with `On Demand` progress
    - This will probably be disabled with a future update
- Add `Default Filler` to `Deco` system
  - After all blocks are scheduled/added to the playout, a second pass will be made to insert filler
  - Default filler will be shuffled and inserted in all unscheduled time between blocks
  - Default filler will stop scheduling when the next item would extend into primary content
  - Alternatively, default filler can be configured to `Trim To Fit`
    - In this case, the last item that would extend into primary content is trimmed to end exactly when the primary content starts
- Add **experimental** playout type `YAML`
  - This playout type uses a YAML file to declare content and describe how the playout should be built
  - Content currently supports search queries
  - Playout instructions currently include `count`, `pad to next`, and `repeat`
    - `count`: add the specified number of items (from the referenced content) to the playout
    - `duration`: play the referenced content for the specified duration
    - `pad to next`: add items from the referenced content until the wall clock is a multiple of the specified minutes value
    - `repeat`: continue building the playout from the first instruction in the YAML file
- Add channel logo generation by @raknam
  - Channels without custom uploaded logos will automatically generate a logo that includes the channel name
- Add two new API endpoints
  - Reset playout for channel
    - POST `/api/channels/{channelNumber}/playout/reset`
  - Scan library
    - POST `/api/libraries/{libraryId}/scan`
- Add Deco setting to `Use Watermark During Filler`
  - This setting is turned OFF by default, meaning filler will NOT use the configured watermark unless this is manually turned on
- Add `Random Count` filler mode by @embolon
  - This mode will randomly schedule between zero and the provided count number of items
  - e.g. random count 3 will schedule between 0 and 3 filler items
- Add `Random Rotation` playback order for block scheduling by @embolon
  - This playback order will pick a random item from a randomly selected group (show or artist)
  - It is somewhat similar to the `Fill With Group` mode used in flood scheduling

### Fixed
- Add basic cache busting to XMLTV image URLs
  - This should help with clients not showing correct channel logos or posters
- Fix artwork in other video libraries by @raknam
- Fix adding items to empty playlists
- Fix filler preset editor and deco dead air fallback editor to only show supported collection types
- Fix infinite loop caused by impossible schedule (all collection items longer than schedule item duration)
- Fix selecting audio and subtitle streams with two-letter language codes
- Fix adding pad filler to content that is less than one minute in duration
- Generate unique identifier for virtual HDHomeRun tuner by @raknam
  - This allows a single Plex server to connect to multiple ETV instances
- Include *all* language codes from media library in preferred audio and subtitle language options
  - Language codes where an English name cannot be found will be at the bottom of the list
- Fix local libraries to detect external subtitle files with unrecognized language codes
- Fix playback selection of subtitles with unrecognized language codes
- Fix incorrectly removing block items that are hidden from EPG when deco filler is applied
- Fix deco selection when deco is scheduled until midnight
  - Previously, this deco item would be ignored so watermark and filler would be missing
- Fix movies with missing medata by generating fallback metadata
  - This allows these movies to appear in the Trash where they can be deleted
- Fix synchronizing trakt lists from users with special characters in their username
  - Note that these lists MUST be added as URLs; the short-form `user/list` will NOT work with special characters
- Fix local subtitle scanner to detect non-lowercase extensions (e.g. `Movie (2000).EN.SRT`)
- Fix adding a single image to a manual collection from search results
- Fix loading manual collection view when collection contains images
- Fix edge case where block playout history would get stuck and repeat an item
- Fix adjusting watermark opacity when watermark already contains alpha channel (is already transparent)

### Changed
- Remove some unnecessary API calls related to media server scanning and paging
- Improve trakt list URL validation; non-trakt URLs will no longer be requested
- Prevent saving block templates when blocks are overlapping
  - This can happen if block durations are changed for blocks that are already on the template
- Redirect variant playlist request to proper URL for starting `HLS Segmenter` session when no session is active
  - This can happen when some clients "pause" long enough for the session to stop in ETV
  - When the client resumes playback, it requests the temp playlist URL which is now invalid e.g. `/iptv/session/1/hls.m3u8` (not the original URL `/iptv/channel/1.m3u8`)
  - To fix, the client will be redirected back to the original URL in this case which will create a new session

## [0.8.7-beta] - 2024-06-26
### Added
- Add `Active Date Range` to block playout template editor to allow limiting templates to a specific date range
  - This is year-agnostic, meaning the Month/Day range will apply to every year
  - This also supports wrapping the end of the year (e.g., start 12/1 and end 1/15)
- Add new `Deco` system for "decorating" channels with non-primary content
  - Decos currently contain
    - Watermarks
    - Dead Air Fallback (i.e. fallback filler)
  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco groups for organization
  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco templates for filling a "day" with decos
  - In the playout template editor, playout template items can have *both* a block template and a deco template
    - This allows watermarks and dead air fallback to change at different times than primary content
  - Block playouts can also have a default deco
    - This will apply whenever a deco template is missing, or when a deco template item cannot be found for the current time
    - Effectively, this sets a default watermark and dead air fallback for the entire playout
- Add `XMLTV Days To Build` setting, which is distinct from the existing `Playout Days To Build` setting
  - The value for `XMLTV Days To Build` cannot be larger than `Playout Days To Build`
  - This allows, for example, a week of playout data while optimizing XMLTV data to only a day or two
- Add health check to detect config folder issue on MacOS
  - ETV versions through v0.8.4-beta (using dotnet 7) stored config data in `$HOME/.local/share/ersatztv`
  - ETV versions starting with v0.8.5-beta (using dotnet 8) store config data in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ersatztv`
  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV has NOT been launched on MacOS, it will automatically migrate the config folder on startup
  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV *has* been launched on MacOS, a failing health check will display with instructions on how to resolve the config issue to restore data
- Add `Video Profile` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor when `h264` format is selected
- Add `Video Preset` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor for some combinations of acceleration and video format:
  - `Nvenc` / `h264`
  - `Nvenc` / `hevc`
  - `Qsv` / `h264`
  - `Qsv` / `hevc`
  - `None` / `h264`
  - `None` / `hevc`
- Add *experimental* list type `Playlist`
  - Playlists contain an ordered list of:
    - Collections
    - Multi-Collections
    - Smart Collections
    - TV Shows
    - TV Seasons
    - Artists
    - Movies
    - Episodes
    - Music Videos
    - Other Videos
    - Songs
    - Images
  - Playlists can be added to schedules as a schedule item
  - Each time through the playlist, one item will be scheduled from each playlist item (if `Play All` is unchecked)
    - NB: This does not mean every collection will always schedule one item; the normal flood playout restrictions like duration and fixed start times still apply here
  - If `Play All` is checked, that playlist item will play all of its items each time through the playlist
    - This can be helpful if you want to play entire collections in a specific order, e.g.
      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 2
      - Every episode from Show 2 Season 3
      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 3
  - Playlist items with fewer media items will be re-shuffled (if applicable) before those with more media items
- Add two new environment variables to customize config and transcode folder locations
  - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER`
  - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER`
- Add checkbox to allow use of B-frames in FFmpeg Profile (disabled by default)

### Fixed
- Fix some cases of 404s from Plex when files were replaced and scanning the library from ETV didn't help
- Fix more wildcard search phrase queries (when wildcards are used in quotes, like `title:"law & order*"`)
- Fix non-wildcard simple queries when asterisks are used in quotes, like `title:"m*a*s*h"`
- Fix bug where channels would unnecessarily wait on each other
  - e.g. in-progress streams would delay responding with a playlist when new streams were starting
- Update Plex show title in ETV when changed in Plex
- Reindex seasons and episodes when show is updated from media server
  - This is needed to keep `show_*` tags accurate in the search index (e.g., `show_title`, `show_studio`)
- Fix external subtitle detection to support forced/sdh subtitles with language tag before and after forced/sdh tag:
  - `Something.forced.en.srt`
  - `Something.sdh.en.srt`
  - `Something.en.forced.srt`
  - `Something.en.sdh.srt`
- Fix playback from Jellyfin 10.9 by allowing playlist HTTP HEAD requests
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` segment duration (previously 10s, now 4s)
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` error video generation
- Fix MySql database migrations
- Fix Plex library scans with MySql/MariaDB
- Fix block playout playback when no deco is configured
- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` to delete old segments (use less disk space while channel is active)
- Fix template and deco template editors to prevent items that go beyond midnight
- Fix block playout random seeds
  - Different blocks within a single playout will now correctly use different random seeds (shuffles)
  - Erasing block playout history will also generate new random seeds for the playout
- Fix building playouts that use mid-roll filler and have content without chapter markers
  - When this happens, mid-roll will be treated as post-roll
- Fix VAAPI decoder capability check
  - This caused some streams to incorrectly use software decoding
- Fix scheduling loop/failure caused by some duration schedule items
- Fix `video_bit_depth` search field for Plex media
- Fix template and deco template editors with MariaDB/MySql backend
- Fix transcoding 10-bit source content using QSV acceleration on Windows

### Changed
- Show health checks at top of home page; scroll release notes if needed
- Improve `HLS Segmenter V2` compliance by:
  - Serving fmp4 segments when `hevc` video format is selected
    - > 1.5. The container format for HEVC video MUST be fMP4.
  - Using accurate BANDWIDTH value in multi-variant playlist
  - Using proper MIME types for statically-served `.m3u8` and `.ts` files
  - Serving playlists with gzip compression
- Use `HLS Segmenter V2` for channel preview when channel is configured for `HLS Segmenter V2`
- Detect and use `/dev/dri/card*` devices in addition to `/dev/dri/render*` devices
- Change default folder locations in docker using new environment variables
    - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/config`
    - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/transcode`
    - If the old locations are still present in docker, these variables will be ignored, so you can migrate at your own pace
      - Old config location: `/root/.local/share/ersatztv`
      - Old transcode location: `/root/.local/share/etv-transcode`

## [0.8.6-beta] - 2024-04-03
### Added
- Add `show_studio` and `show_content_rating` to search index for seasons and episodes
- Add two new global subtitle settings:
  - `Use embedded subtitles`
    - Default value: `true`
    - When disabled, embedded subtitles will not be considered for extraction (text subtitles), or playback (all embedded subtitles)
  - `Extract and use embedded (text) subtitles`
    - Default value: `false`
    - When enabled, embedded text subtitles will be periodically extracted, and considered for playback
- Add `sub_language` and `sub_language_tag` fields to search index
- Add `/iptv` request logging in its own log category at debug level
- Add channel guide (XMLTV) template system
  - Templates should be copied from `_channel.sbntxt`, `_movie.sbntxt`, `_episode.sbntxt`, `_musicVideo.sbntxt`, `_song.sbntxt`, or `_otherVideo.sbntxt` which are located in the config subfolder `templates/channel-guide`
    - Copy the file, remove the leading underscore from the name, and only make edits to the copied file
  - The default templates will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started
  - The templates use [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax
  - The templates contain comments describing which fields are available for use in the templates
- Add *experimental* and *incomplete* `Images` library kind
  - Image libraries have fallback metadata added like Other Video libraries (every folder is a tag)
  - Image library items currently default to a duration of 15 seconds
    - The `Media` > `Images` page can be used to configure image durations at a folder level
    - Child folders with unset durations will inherit the closest ancestor's duration
- Add *experimental* new streaming mode `HLS Segmenter V2`
  - In my initial testing, this streaming mode produces significantly fewer playback warnings/errors
  - If it tests well for others, it *may* replace the current `HLS Segmenter` in a future release
- Add setting to change XMLTV data from `Local` time zone to `UTC`
  - This is needed because some clients (incorrectly) ignore time zone specifier and require UTC times
- Support `.ogv` video files in local libraries

### Fixed
- Fix antiforgery error caused by reusing existing browser tabs across docker container restarts
  - Data protection keys will now be persisted under ErsatzTV's config folder instead of being recreated at startup
- Fix bug updating/replacing Jellyfin movies
  - A deep scan can be used to fix all movies, otherwise any future updates made to JF movies will correctly sync to ETV
- Automatically generate JWT tokens to allow channel previews of protected streams
- Fix bug applying music video fallback metadata
- Fix playback of media items with no audio streams
- Fix timestamp continuity in `HLS Segmenter` sessions
  - This should make *some* clients happier
- Fix `Other Video`, `Song` and `Image` fallback metadata tags to always include parent folder (folder added to library)
- Allow playback of items with any positive duration, including less than one second
- Fix VAAPI transcoding of OTA content containing A53 CC data
- Fix AV1 software decoder priority (`libdav1d`, `libaom-av1`, `av1`)
- Fix some stream failures caused by loudnorm filter
- Fix multi-collection editor improperly disabling collections/smart collections that haven't already been added to the multi-collection
- Fix path replacement logic when media server paths use inconsistent casing (e.g. `\\SERVERNAME` AND `\\ServerName`)
- Fix *many* search queries, including actors with the name `Will`
- Fix sqlite `database is locked` error that would crash ETV on startup after search index corruption
- Fix bug where replacing files in Plex would be missed by subsequent ETV library scans
  - This fix will require a one-time re-scan of each Plex library in full
  - After the initial full scan, incremental scans will behave as normal
- Fix edge case where some local episodes, music videos, other videos, songs, images would not automatically be restored from trash
- Fix `MPEG-TS` playback when JWT tokens are enabled for streaming endpoints

### Changed
- Log search index updates under scanner category at debug level, to indicate a potential cause for the UI being out of date
- Batch search index updates to keep pace with library scans
  - Previously, search index updates would slowly process over minutes/hours after library scans completed
  - Search index updates should now complete at the same time as library scans
- Do not unnecessarily update the search index during media server library scans
- Use different library for reading song metadata that supports multiple tag entries
- Update `/iptv` routing to make UI completely inaccessible from that path prefix
- Use CUDA 11 instead of CUDA 12 in NVIDIA docker image to significantly lower required driver version
- Allow block durations with 5-minute increments (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc.)

## [0.8.5-beta] - 2024-01-30
### Added
- Respect browser's `Accept-Language` header for date time display
- Add new schedule item setting `Fill With Group Mode`
  - This setting is only available when a `Collection`, `Multi-Collection` or `Smart Collection` is scheduled with `Duration` or `Multiple` playout modes
  - Use this setting when you want to schedule a collection containing groups (show or artists), with only videos from a single group (show or artist) being used in each rotation
  - The options are `None`, `Ordered Groups` and `Shuffled Groups`:
    - `None`: no change to scheduling behavior - all groups (shows and artists) will be shuffled/ordered together
    - `Ordered Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a fixed order
    - `Shuffled Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a shuffled order
- Add new playout type `External Json`
  - Use this playout type when you want to manage the channel schedule using DizqueTV
  - You must point ErsatzTV to the channel number json file from DizqueTV, e.g. `channels/1.json`
  - For playback, ErsatzTV will first check for the appropriate media file file locally
    - If found, ErsatzTV will run ffprobe to get statistics immediately before streaming from disk
  - When local files are unavailable, ErsatzTV must be logged into the same Plex server as DizqueTV
    - ErsatzTV will ask Plex for statistics immediately before streaming from Plex
- Add new *experimental* playout type `Block`
  - **This playout type is under active development and updates may reset or delete related playout data**
  - Many planned features are missing, incomplete, or result in errors. This is expected.
  - Block playouts consist of:
    - `Blocks` - ordered list of items to play within the specified duration
    - `Templates` - a generic "day" that consists of blocks scheduled at specific times
    - `Playout Templates` - templates to schedule using the specified criteria. Only one template will be selected each day
  - Much more to come on this feature as development continues
- Show chapter markers in movie and episode media info
- Add two new API endpoints for interacting with transcoding sessions (MPEG-TS and HLS Segmenter):
  - GET `/api/sessions`
    - Show brief info about all active sessions
  - DELETE `/api/session/{channel-number}`
    - Stop the session for the given channel number
- Add channel preview (web-based video player)
  - Channels MUST use `H264` video format and `AAC` audio format
  - Channels MUST use `MPEG-TS` or `HLS Segmenter` streaming modes
    - Since `MPEG-TS` uses `HLS Segmenter` under the hood, the preview player will use `HLS Segmenter`, so it's not 100% equivalent, but it should be representative
- Add button to stop transcoding session for each channel that has an active session
- Add more log levels to `Settings` page, allowing more specific debug logging as needed
    - Default Minimum Log Level (applies when no other categories/level overrides match)
    - Scanning Minimum Log Level
    - Scheduling Minimum Log Level
    - Streaming Minimum Log Level

### Fixed

- Ignore errors deleting old HLS segments; this should improve stream reliability
- Update show year when changed within Plex
- Fix crop scale behavior with NVIDIA, QSV acceleration
- Fix bug that corrupted uploaded images (watermarks, channel logos)
  - Re-uploading images should fix them
- Recreate XMLTV channel list (including logos) when channels are edited in ErsatzTV
  - This bug caused the ErsatzTV logo to be used instead of channel logos in some cases
- Update drop down search results in main search bar when items are created/edited/removed
- Fix green line at bottom of video when NVIDIA accel is used with intermittent watermark
- Fix error starting streaming session when subtitles are still being extracted for the current item

### Changed
- Upgrade from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- In schedule items, disambiguate seasons from shows with the same title by including show year
  - Old format: `Show Title (Season Number)`

  - This bug affected Jellyfin, Emby and Plex collections
- Fix detection of AMF hardware acceleration on Windows

## [0.8.3-beta] - 2023-11-22
### Added
- Add `Scaling Behavior` option to FFmpeg Profile
  - `Scale and Pad`: the default behavior and will maintain aspect ratio of all content
  - `Stretch`: a new mode that will NOT maintain aspect ratio when normalizing source content to the desired resolution
  - `Crop`: a new mode that will scale beyond the desired resolution (maintaining aspect ratio), and crop to desired resolution
    - **This mode does NOT detect black and intelligently crop**
    - The goal is to fill the canvas by over-scaling and cropping, instead of minimally scaling and padding
- Include `inputstream.ffmpegdirect` properties in channels.m3u when requested by Kodi
- Log playout item title and path when starting a stream
  - This will help with media server libraries where the URL passed to ffmpeg doesn't indicate which file is streaming

### Fixed
- Fix playout bug that caused some schedule items with fixed start times to be pushed to the next day
- Fix playout bug that prevented padded durations from fitting within a schedule item of the same duration
  - For example, filler that padded to 30 minutes would often not fit in a 30 minute duration schedule item
- Fix VAAPI transcoding 8-bit source content to 10-bit
- Fix NVIDIA subtitle scaling when `scale_npp` filter is unavailable
- Remove ffmpeg and ffprobe as required dependencies for scanning media server libraries
  - Note that ffmpeg is still *always* required for playback to work
- Fix PGS subtitle pixel format with Intel VAAPI
- Fix some cases where `Copy` button would fail to copy to clipboard
- Fix some cases where ffmpeg process would remain running after properly closing ErsatzTV

- Fix MySQL queries that could fail during media server library scans
- Fix scanning Jellyfin libraries when library options and/or path infos are not returned from Jellyfin API
- Fix error indexing music videos in `File Not Found` state
- Fix bug scheduling duration filler when filler collection contains item with zero duration
- Fix bug displaying television seasons for shows that have no year metadata

### Changed
- Upgrade ffmpeg to 6.1, which is now *required* for all installs
- Use new ffmpeg throttling method to minimize cpu/gpu use without impacting audio normalization
- Change FFmpeg Profile `Normalize Loudness` setting from checkbox to dropdown
  - `Off`: do not normalize loudness
  - `loudnorm`: use `loudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally higher CPU use)
  - `dynaudnorm`: use `dynaudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally lower CPU use)
- Jellyfin collection scanning will no longer happen after every (automatic or forced) library scan
    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned
    - There is a new table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Jellyfin collections as needed
- In FFmpeg Profile editor, only display hardware acceleration kinds that are supported by the configured ffmpeg
- Test QSV acceleration if configured, and fallback to software mode if test fails
- Detect QSV capabilities on Linux (supported decoders, encoders)
- Use hardware acceleration for error messages/offline messages
- Try to parse season number from season folder when Jellyfin does not provide season number
  - This *may* fix issues where Jellyfin libraries show all season numbers as 0 (specials)
- Rework Plex collection scanning
    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned
    - There is a table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Plex collections as needed
    - Plex smart collections will now be synchronized as tags, similar to other Plex collections

## [0.8.2-beta] - 2023-09-14
### Added
- Automatically rebuild search index after improper shutdown
- Add *experimental* support for Elasticsearch as search index backend
  - No query changes should be needed since ES is backed by lucene and supports the same query syntax
  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `ELASTICSEARCH__URI` (e.g. `http://localhost:9200`)
    - `ELASTICSEARCH__INDEXNAME` (default is `ersatztv`)
- Add *experimental* support for MySQL/MariaDB database provider
  - ***There is no functionality to migrate data between providers***
  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `PROVIDER` - set to `MySql`
    - `MYSQL__CONNECTIONSTRING` - (e.g. `Server=localhost;Database=ErsatzTV;Uid=root;Pwd=ersatztv;`)
- Add option to use shared Plex servers, not just owned servers
  - This can be enabled by setting the env var `ETV_ALLOW_SHARED_PLEX_SERVERS` to any non-empty value
- Show Plex server names in Libraries page

### Fixed
- Fix subtitle scaling when using QSV hardware acceleration

- Fix adding alternate schedule
- Fix parsing show title from NFO file that also contains season information

### Changed
- Optimize transcoding session to only work ahead (at max speed) for 3 minutes before throttling to realtime
  - This should *greatly* reduce cpu/gpu use when joining a channel, particularly with long content
- Allow manually editing (typing) schedule item fixed start time
- Use different control for editing schedule item duration, and allow 24-hour duration
  - This is needed if you want a default/fallback alternate schedule to fill the entire day with one schedule item
  - The schedule item should have a fixed start time of midnight (00:00) and a duration of 24 hours
- Use Direct3D 11 for QSV acceleration on Windows

## [0.8.1-beta] - 2023-08-07
### Added

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2023-06-23
### Added
- Disable playout buttons and show spinning indicator when a playout is being modified (built/extended, or subtitles are being extracted)
- Automatically reload playout details table when playout build is complete
- Add `Discard To Fill Attempts` setting to duration playout mode
  - This setting only has an effect when it's configured to be greater than zero and when using `Shuffle` or `Random` playback order
  - When the current item is longer than the remaining duration, it will be discarded and ETV will try to fit the next item in the collection, up to the configured number of times
  - When the remaining duration is shorter than all items in the collection, the normal filler logic will be used
- Add `Finish` column to playout detail table

### Fixed
- Skip checking for subtitles to extract when subtitles are not enabled on a channel/schedule item
- Properly scale subtitles when using hardware acceleration
- Fix color normalization of content with missing color metadata when using NVIDIA acceleration
- `VAAPI`: explicitly use `CQP` rate control mode when it's the only compatible mode
- Fix scaling anamorphic Emby content that Emby claims is not anamorphic

### Changed
- `HLS Direct` streaming mode
    - Use `MPEG-TS` container/output format by default to maintain v0.7.8 compatibility
      - `MP4` and `MKV` container/output format can still be configured in `Settings`
    - Improve `MP4` compatibility with certain content
- For `Pad` and `Duration` filler - prioritize filling the configured pad/duration
  - This will skip filler that is too long in an attempt to avoid unscheduled time
  - You may see the same filler more often, which means you may want to add more filler to your library so ETV has more options
- Update ffmpeg, libraries and drivers in all docker images

## [0.7.9-beta] - 2023-06-10
### Added
- Synchronize actor metadata from Jellyfin and Emby television libraries
  - New libraries and new episodes will get actor data automatically

    - `MKV` output format: stream copy any embedded subtitles

### Fixed
- Fix extracting embedded text subtitles that had been incompletely extracted in the past
- Fix fallback filler looping by forcing software mode for this content
  - Other content will still use hardware acceleration as configured
  - Hardware-accelerated fallback filler may be re-enabled in the future
- Fix playout building when shuffle in order is used with a single media item
- Fix pgs subtitle burn in from media server libraries
- Fix subtitle and watermark overlays with RadeonSI VAAPI driver
- Fix NVIDIA pipeline to use hardware-accelerated decoder with 8-bit h264 content

### Changed
- Timeout playout builds after 2 minutes; this should prevent playout bugs from blocking other functionality

- Remove duplicate items from smart collections before scheduling
  - i.e. shows no longer need to be filtered out if search results also include episodes
  - Certain multi-collection scenarios may still include duplicates across multiple collections
- Use autocomplete fields for collection searching in schedule items editor
  - This greatly improves the editor performance
- Ignore dot underscore files

## [0.7.7-beta] - 2023-04-07

  - When configured, a JWT signed with the configured signing key is required to be passed in the query string as `access_token`, for example:
    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/channels.m3u?access_token=ABCDEF`
    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/xmltv.xml?access_token=ABCDEF`
  - When channels are retrieved this way, the access token will automatically be passed through to all necessary urls
  - Note that ONLY the `/iptv` endpoints will require auth when JWT is configured

### Fixed
- Fix scaling anamorphic content from non-local libraries
- Fix direct streaming content from Jellyfin that has external subtitles

  - File systems will no longer be periodically scanned for libraries using these media sources
- Plex, Jellyfin and Emby libraries now direct stream content when files are not found on ErsatzTV's file system
  - Content will still be normalized according to the Channel and FFmpeg Profile settings
  - Streaming from disk is preferred, so every playback attempt will first check the local file system
- Use libvpl instead of libmfx to provide intel acceleration in vaapi docker images
- Search queries no longer remove duplicate results as this was causing incorrect behavior
- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as "default" over number of audio channels
    - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a mono "default" track will now prefer the "default" track
- Support many more season folder names with local television libraries

## [0.7.4-beta] - 2023-02-12
### Added
- Add button to copy/clone schedule from schedules table
- Synchronize episode tags and genres from Jellyfin, Emby and Local show libraries
- Add `Deep Scan` button to Jellyfin and Emby libraries
  - This is now required to update some metadata for existing libraries, when targeted updates are not possible

### Fixed
- Fix many QSV pipeline bugs
- Fix MPEG2 video format with QSV and VAAPI acceleration
- Fix playback of content with undefined colorspace
- Fix NVIDIA color normalization with VP9 sources
- Fix fallback filler looping
- Fix bug where some libraries would never scan

  - This caused overlapping schedule items, fallback filler that was too long, etc.

### Changed
- Merge generated `Other Video` folder tags with tags from sidecar NFO
- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as "default" when multiple candidate streams are available
  - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a stereo "default" track will now prefer the "default" track

## [0.7.3-beta] - 2023-01-25
### Added
- Attempt to release memory periodically
- Add OpenID Connect (OIDC) support (e.g. Keycloak, Authelia, Auth0)
  - This only protects the management UI; all streaming endpoints will continue to allow anonymous access
  - This can be configured with the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)
    - `OIDC__AUTHORITY`
    - `OIDC__CLIENTID`
    - `OIDC__CLIENTSECRET`
    - `OIDC__LOGOUTURI` (optional, needed for Auth0, use `https://{auth0-domain}/v2/logout?client_id={auth0-client-id}` with proper values for domain and client-id)
- Add *experimental* alternate schedule system
  - This allows a single playout to dynamically select a schedule based on date criteria, for example:
    - Weekday vs weekend schedules
    - Summer vs fall schedules
    - Shark week schedules
  - Alternate schedules can be managed by clicking the calendar icon in the playout list
  - Playouts contain a prioritized (top to bottom) list of alternate schedules
  - Whenever a playout is built for a given day, ErsatzTV will check for a matching schedule from top to bottom
  - A given day must match all alternate schedule parameters; wildcards (`*any*`) will always match
    - Day of week
    - Day of month
    - Month
  - The lowest priority (bottom) item will always match all parameters, and can be considered a "default" or "fallback" schedule

### Fixed
- Fix schedule editor crashing due to bad music video artist data
- Fix bug where playouts would not maintain smart collection progress on schedules that use multiple smart collections
- Fix library scanning on osx-arm64
- Fix ability to remove some media server libraries from ErsatzTV

- Fix saving some external subtitle records to database

### Changed
- Upgrade to dotnet 7
- Upgrade all docker images to ubuntu jammy and ffmpeg 5.1.2
- Limit library scan interval between 0 and 1,000,000
  - 0 means do not automatically scan libraries
  - 1 to 999,999 means scan if it has been that many hours since the last scan
- Use new `ErsatzTV.Scanner` process for scanning all libraries
  - This should reduce the ongoing memory footprint

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2022-12-11
### Fixed
- Fix removing Jellyfin and Emby libraries that have been deleted from the source media server
- Fix `Work-Ahead HLS Segmenter Limit` setting to properly limit number of channels that can work-ahead at once

        - `isForced`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as forced
        - `language`: the stream's language
        - `title`: the stream's title
- Add new fields to search index
  - `video_codec`: the video codec
  - `video_bit_depth`: the number of bits in the video stream's pixel format, e.g. 8 or 10
  - `video_dynamic_range`: the video's dynamic range, either `sdr` or `hdr`

### Changed
- Change `Multi-Episode Shuffle` scripting system to use Javascript instead of Lua

## [0.6.9-beta] - 2022-10-21
### Fixed

- Fix NFO reader bug that caused inaccurate warning messages about invalid XML and incomplete metadata
- Fix reverse proxy SSL termination support by supporting `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
- Fix automatic playout reset scheduling
  - Playouts would reset every 30 minutes between midnight and the configured time, instead of only at the configured time
- XMLTV: properly group schedule items with `Custom Title` followed by item(s) with `Guide Mode` set to `Filler`

### Added
- Add music video credits template system
  - Templates are selected in each channel's settings
  - Templates should be copied from `_default.ass.sbntxt` which is located in the config subfolder `templates/music-video-credits`
    - Copy the file, give it any name ending with `.ass.sbntext`, and only make edits to the copied file
  - The default template will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started
  - The template is an [Advanced SubStation Alpha](http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm) file using [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax
  - The following fields are available for use in the template:

    - `stream_seek`: the timespan that ffmpeg will seek into the media item before beginning playback
- Add `Multi-Episode Shuffle` playout order for `Television Show` schedule items
  - The purpose of this playout order is to improve randomization for shows that normally have intro, multiple episodes, and outro
  - This playout order requires splitting the parts into individual files (e.g. splitting `s01e01-03.mkv` into `s01e01.mkv`, `s01e02.mkv` and `s01e03.mkv`)
  - This playout order requires a lua script in the config subfolder `scripts/multi-episode-shuffle`
  - The lua script should be named for the television show's guid, e.g. `tvdb_12345.lua` or `imdb_tt123456789.lua`
  - The script defines the number of parts that each un-split file typically contains
  - The script also defines a function to map each episode to a part number (or no part number i.e. `nil` if an episode has not been split)
  - All groups of part numbers (i.e. all part 1s, all part 2s) will be shuffled
  - The playout order will then schedule a random part 1 followed by a random part 2, etc
    - Un-split (`nil`) episodes will be randomly placed between re-combined parts (e.g. part1, part2, part3, un-split, part1, part2, part3)
- Add `ETV_BASE_URL` environment variable to support reverse proxies that use paths (e.g. `/ersatztv`)

### Changed
- No longer place watermarks within content by default (e.g. within 4:3 content padded to a 16:9 resolution)
  - This can be re-enabled if desired using the `Place Within Source Content` checkbox in watermark settings

## [0.6.8-beta] - 2022-10-05
### Fixed
- Fix typo introduced in `0.6.7-beta` that stopped QSV HEVC encoder from working

- Add guids to search index (e.g. `imdb:tt000000`, `tvdb:12345`)

## [0.6.7-beta] - 2022-09-05
### Fixed
- When all audio streams are selected with `HLS Direct`, explicitly copy them without transcoding
  - This only happens when the channel does not have a `Preferred Audio Language`
- Fix scanner crash caused by invalid mtime
- `VAAPI`: Downgrade libva from 2.15 to 2.14
- Fix bug with XMLTV that caused some filler to display with primary content details
- Multiple fixes for content scaling with `Nvidia`, `Qsv` and `Vaapi` accelerations

  - Logic was also added to detect infinite playout build loops in the future and stop them
- Fix bug where `Other Videos` wouldn't be included in scheduling mode `Shuffle In Order`

### Added
- Add `Preferred Audio Title` feature
    - Preference can be configured in channel settings and overridden on schedule items
    - When a title is specified, audio streams that contain that title (case-insensitive search) will be prioritized
    - This can be helpful for creating channels that use commentary tracks
    - External tooling exists to easily update title/name metadata if your audio streams don't already have this metadata
- Add `Amf` hardware acceleration option for AMD GPUs on Windows
- Add `QSV Extra Hardware Frames` parameter for tuning QSV acceleration
  - Performance may improve on some systems after doubling or halving the default value of `64`

## [0.6.6-beta] - 2022-08-17
### Fixed
- Use MIME Type `application/x-mpegurl` for all playlists instead of `application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`
- Replace `setsar` filter with `setdar` filter
  - `setsar` caused issues scaling between two different aspect ratios
    - For example, some 4:3 content would appear stretched when scaled to a 16:9 resolution
  - `setdar` is now only used when aspect ratios match
- Prioritize aspect ratio from container when video stream contains conflicting aspect ratio
  - This is usually caused by bad authoring, but the change should improve scaling behavior for edge cases

### Added
- Support DSD audio file formats (DFF and DSF) in local song libraries
- Support OGG audio file formats (OGG, OPUS, OGA, OGX, SPX) in local song libraries

### Changed

- Fix scheduling bug where flood items would sometimes fail to continue after midnight

### Added
- Add `metadata_kind` field to search index to allow searching for items with a particular metdata source
  - Valid metadata kinds are `fallback`, `sidecar` (NFO), `external` (from a media server) and `embedded` (songs)
- Add autocomplete functionality to search bar to quickly navigate to channels, ffmpeg profiles, collections and schedules by name
- Add global setting to skip missing (file-not-found or unavailable) items when building playouts
- Add filler preset option to allow watermarks to overlay on top of filler (disabled by default)
  - This option is applied when new items are added to a playout; rebuilding is needed if you want the change to take effect immediately
- Read `track` field from music video NFO metadata and use it for chronological sorting (after release date)
- Add `Random Start Point` option to schedules
  - When this option is enabled, all `Chronological` or `Shuffle In Order` content groups will have their start points randomized

### Changed
- Replace invalid (control) characters in NFO metadata with replacement character `�` before parsing
- Store partial (incomplete) NFO metadata results when invalid XML is encountered
  - Previously, no metadata would be stored if the XML within the NFO failed to validate

  - After updating mounts, path replacements, etc - a library scan can be used to resolve this state

## [0.5.2-beta] - 2022-04-22
### Fixed
- Fix unlocking libraries when scanning fails for any reason
- Fix software overlay of actual size watermark

### Added
- Add support for burning in embedded and external text subtitles
  - **This requires a one-time full library scan, which may take a long time with large libraries.**

  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:"Collection Name"`
  - Note that Emby has an outstanding collections bug that prevents updates when removing items from a collection
- Sync Plex labels as tags on movies and shows
  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:"Plex Label Name"`
- Add `Deep Scan` button for Plex libraries
  - This scanning mode is *slow* but is required to detect some changes like labels

  - Schedule Item
  - Channel
  - Global

### Changed
- Remove legacy transcoder logic option; all channels will use the new transcoder logic
- Renamed channel setting `Preferred Language` to `Preferred Audio Language`
- Reworked playout build logic to maintain collection progress in some scenarios. There are now three build modes:
  - `Continue` - add new items to the end of an existing playout
    - This mode is used when playouts are automatically extended in the background
  - `Refresh` - this mode will try to maintain collection progress while rebuilding the entire playout
    - This mode is used when a schedule is updated, or when collection modifications trigger a playout rebuild
  - `Reset` - this mode will rebuild the entire playout and will NOT maintain progress
    - This mode is only used when the `Reset Playout` button is clicked on the Playouts page
  - **This requires rebuilding all playouts, which will happen on startup after upgrading**
- Use ffmpeg to resize images; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use
- Use ffprobe to check for animated logos and watermarks; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use
- Allow two decimals in channel numbers (e.g. `5.73`)

## [0.4.5-alpha] - 2022-03-29
### Fixed
- Fix streaming mode inconsistencies when `mode` parameter is unspecified
- Fix startup on Windows 7

### Added
- Add option to automatically deinterlace video when transcoding
  - Previously, this was always enabled; the purpose of the option is to allow disabling any deinterlace filters
  - Note that there is no performance gain to disabling the option with progressive content; filters are only ever applied to interlaced content

### Changed
- Change FFmpeg Profile video codec and audio codec text fields to select fields
  - The appropriate video encoder will be determined based on the video format and hardware acceleration selections
- Remove FFmpeg Profile `Transcode`, `Normalize Video` and `Normalize Audio` settings

- Add `album_artist` to song metadata and to search index
- Display `album_artist` on some song videos when it's different than the `artist`

### Changed
- Framerate normalization will never normalize framerate below 24fps
  - Instead, content with a lower framerate will be normalized up to 24fps
- `Shuffle In Order` will group songs by album artist instead of by track artist

## [0.4.2-alpha] - 2022-02-26

### Added
- Add Smart Collections
  - Smart Collections use search queries and can be created from the search result page
  - Smart Collections are re-evaluated every time playouts are extended or rebuilt to automatically include newly-matching items
